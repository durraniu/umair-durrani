## Mitigating Distracted Driving based on Understanding of Drivers’ Personality, Motivational, and Mobile Phone Dependency Characteristics. Road Safety Research Partnership Program (RSRPP), Ministry of Transportation of Ontario	(2020 – Present)


In this project, I worked with a team to develop driving simulator scenarios for evaluating driver distraction. I developed and deployed a dashboard application that worked with real-time driving simulator data to evaluate driver distraction due to music and navigation tasks. I also wrote computer programs to extract and analyze driving data and participant heart rate data.

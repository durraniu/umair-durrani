## Safety Impacts of a Variable Speed Limit System. Highway Infrastructure Innovation Funding Program (HIIFP), Ministry of Transportation of Ontario	(2018 â€“ 2019)

In this project, I worked with a team to develop a new criteria to propose various sites for the deployment of the Variable Speed Limit System in Ontario. I analyzed the weather patterns in Ontario to identify the locations with the most severe weather conditions. Furthermore, I developed an interactive map application for the visualization of precipitation and proposed sites for the Variable Speed Limit System in Ontario.

## Classifying Drivers using Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques. In collaboration with University of South Florida (2021 - 2022)

- Developed clusters of drivers with similar behaviours based on self-reported, psychophysiological, and performance metrics within a simulated environment  
- Applied machine learning models to predict moderate and conservative drivers

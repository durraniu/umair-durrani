## Development of an Algorithm to Improve Autonomous Driving Performance in a Mixed Traffic of Autonomous and Human driving Vehicle, Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea	(2022 â€“ 2023)


In this project, I developed a driving simulator study with a team where we specified the behaviors of autonomous and human-driven vehicles in the simulation. This study collected driving and sensor data (eye-tracker, EGG, bio-signals, etc.). I wrote part of the [software](https://github.com/durraniu/daqr) that cleaned and extracted driving data from the simulator.

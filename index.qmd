# Hello there, I am Umair Durrani

I am a transportation data scientist and traffic modeler at the [Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/civil/). I study and develop models of road users for traffic flow modeling. Moreover, I teach programmatic data analysis to students in the Transportation Systems Innovation Lab.

I am also an instructor of [Data Analytics at St. Clair College, Windsor, Ontario](https://www.stclaircollege.ca/programs/data-analytics-business). I teach Statistics and data analytics using Python, R, Tableau, Excel, etc. I also supervise capstone projects of students from diverse backgrounds.

I speak **English**, **Urdu** and **R** (programming) fluently. You can get in touch with me via [email](mailto:umairdurrani@outlook.com) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/umairdurrani87).

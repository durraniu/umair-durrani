# Hello there, I am Umair Durrani

I am a transportation data scientist and I am passionate about understanding, modeling, and mitigating human error in transportation systems. 

During my PhD in transportation engineering, I studied and developed models of road users for traffic flow modeling. I was also an instructor of Data Analytics at St. Clair College, Windsor, Ontario. 

I speak **English**, **Urdu** and **R** (programming) fluently. You can get in touch with me via [email](mailto:umairdurrani@outlook.com) or [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@transportationtalk).

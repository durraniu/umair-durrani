<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/discover-canada.html">Discover Canada</a> is a study guide that is a required read for anyone preparing for the Canadian citizenship test. It contains information on Canadian government, culture and geography.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of history sprinkled throughout the text, containing the exact year when something important happened. For example, the current border between Canada and The United States of America was partly a result of the 1812 war between the two countries.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-i-use-r-to-create-a-history-timeline">Can I use R to create a history timeline?</h2>
<p>As a new reader, trying to remember all of the Canadian histoy seems very daunting. I personally prefer a timeline with year and <code>what happened</code> information. So, I initially thought to create something like that by hand, but then:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recalled that <em>Discover Canada</em> is also available as a pdf and I could potentially import it in <code>R</code> as text</li>
<li>I had heard the term <em>corpus</em> used for text documents in <code>R</code>, and thought that I could maybe convert the imported text into a corpus. A recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYuTFy_JRLA">R Ladies webinar</a> showed exactly how (Thank you R-Ladies Tunis!)</li>
<li>With text in <code>R</code>, I could use the <code>tidytext</code> package to extract the sentences and then get the history by years</li>
<li>Finally, I could create a table with history in each year in increasing order using <code>reactable</code> package. My starting point here was <a href="https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-reactable-tables-the-rest-of-the-owl/">Tom Mock’s blog</a> (thanks Tom!)</li>
</ul>

<section id="step-1-from-pdf-to-dataframe" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-from-pdf-to-dataframe">Step 1: From pdf to dataframe</h2>
<p>I started by loading the <code>pdftools</code> and <code>quanteda</code> libraries for reading the <em>Discover Canada</em> pdf file and converting it into a corpus.</p>

<p>I first downloaded the large print pdf file from the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/discover-canada.html">Discover Canada website</a>. Following shows the page 13 from the pdf:</p>

<p>The next step was to convert the raw text into a corpus. This is possible with the <code>corpus()</code> function from the <code>quanteda</code> package:</p>

<p>The <code>quanteda::docvars()</code> function lets you find the existing variables and create new variables for the documents in a corpus. There were 129 text “documents” in <code>dc_corpus</code> (you can find it with <code>length(dc_corpus)</code>). We know that there is only 1 document that I am using here, but the <code>pdftools::pdftext()</code> function split the original text into 129 parts. That’s why the corpus now has 129 documents.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interlude-tokenization-and-visualization-of-text-data">Interlude: Tokenization and Visualization of Text Data</h3>
<p>Now that the data is living in a corpus, there is a lot that I can do in terms of text analysis. For instance, <a href="https://nlp-bergen.netlify.app/">this awesome post</a> by the R-Ladies presenter, <a href="https://twitter.com/cosima_meyer">Cosima Meyer</a> introduces the terms for natural language processing and also shows how to clean and visualize text data. Based on that code, I produced a word cloud in three steps below, all powered by the <code>quanteda</code> package:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-process the text by removing punctuation, symbols and URL, and splitting the hyphenated words. This pre-processed result is called as tokens.</li>
</ul>

<li>Create a document-feature matrix (DFM). DFM estimates the frequency of each word (‘feature’) across all the text components (‘documents’). While creating DFM you can also <em>stem</em> words. Stemming refers to finding the common root of several words. For example, <em>government</em> and <em>governor</em> have the same root <strong>govern</strong>. Moreover, you can remove the <em>stopwords</em> that are common words in the language e.g.&nbsp;<em>the</em>, <em>are</em>, etc.</li>

Ideally, I want to extract the most useful phrases from each sentence for a given year, but at this point I do not know the best way to do that programmatically.

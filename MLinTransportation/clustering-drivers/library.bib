abstract = {Design consistency refers to the conformance of a highway's geometry to driver expectancy. Drivers make fewer errors in the vicinity of geometric features that conform to their expectations. A technique to evaluate the consistency of a design is to evaluate changes in operating speeds along an alignment. To use operating speed as a consistency tool requires the ability to accurately predict speeds as a function of the roadway geometry. In this research project, several efforts were undertaken to predict operating speed for different conditions such as on horizontal, vertical, and combined curves; on tangent sections using alignment indices; on grades using the TWOPAS model; and prior to or after a horizontal curve. The findings from the different efforts were incorporated into a speed-profile model. The model can be used to evaluate the design consistency of the roadway or can be used to develop a speed profile for an alignment. The model considers both horizontal and vertical curvature and the acceleration or deceleration behavior as a vehicle moves from one feature to another.},

abstract = {In order to understand driver's safety-related approaching behaviour during car-following process in more depth, it is necessary to achieve the comprehensive analysis of vehicle-to-vehicle dynamic interactions. Based on qualitative description of driving shaping behaviour associated with driving human factors of influencing driver's car-following behaviour, this paper presents briefly the fundamentals of simulation modelling of driver's safety approaching behaviour in urban traffic operation. The emphasis on our research is placed on the development of a driver's safety approaching behavioural model by considering the variability of following vehicle's speed to the leading vehicle's one and the relative distances among vehicles. Furthermore, we have carried out simulation and analysis of driver's deceleration and acceleration behaviour under different driving situations after identified the key safety-related parameters. Finally the developed model has been validated by using detailed vehicle trajectory data that was collected in naturalistic driving environment. The results show that the safety-based approaching behavioural model could be used to analyze driver's car-following behaviour for driving support and to reveal the essence of traffic flow characteristics at the microscopic level. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The ability to detect the sign of relative motion in the driving situation was investigated on a freeway. Subject passengers in a specially instrumented vehicle were given controlled looks, normally of four sec. duration, of a lead car. It was the subjects' task to estimate whether the two cars had come closer or moved further apart during the exposure. The comparative ability of nine stimulus functions to predict the detection of the sign of relative motion was examined. The most consistent results were obtained when it was assumed that the response was to either the average value of relative speed during the exposure divided by spacing or to the spacing change divided by spacing. One of the most consistent effects observed was a response bias in favor of indicating that the cars had come closer when they had not. The results of the experiment indicate considerable sensitivity to the sign of relative motion. {\textcopyright} 1974, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study predicted the driver's reaction time in approaching and braking conditions using the Wiedemann car-following model and the Accumulator model. Data were collected from a driving simulator in two scenarios: 1) approach and follow a moving lead vehicle and 2) approach a stopped lead vehicle. The reaction times were predicted based on looming (angular velocity due to the width and height of lead vehicle, tau-inverse), lead vehicle type (car and truck), and lead vehicle brake lights (on or off). It was found that the the reaction time depends on looming in both approaching and braking conditions. The calibration of the Accumulator model shows that different looming variables better predicted the reaction time in different driving conditions. In general, the drivers were more sensitive to tau-inverse in urgent situations (approaching a stopped vehicle or braking before a moving vehicle) than angular velocity. The drivers were also more sensitive to angular velocity due to the height of lead truck than the width of lead truck. Moreover, the effect of lead vehicle brake lights on the reaction time was significant. The Accumulator model showed lower prediction errors of the reaction time than the Wiedeman model. In particular, the Wiedemann model predicted unrealistically long reaction times due to the assumption of constant looming threshold. The Accumulator model overcomes this limitation of the Wiedemann model by capturing a time lag in reactions as driving conditions change. Thus, the Accumulator model is a promising method of predicting the driver's reaction time in car-following situations.},

The extreme cases for car-following behaviors are discussed and the range of the car-following distance and the relationship between the car-following distance and three factors, including the roughness of road surface, the velocity of vehicles and the reaction time of drivers are derived, respectively. Finally, regarding the lower limit of the range of the car-following distance as governing equation for safety distance, we have obtained the optimal values of safety distance under different road conditions, such as roads with anti-skid surface, asphalts pavement, rain, snow and ice. Compared with the safety distance in “the Road Traffic Safe Law”, the rationality of this safety distance design is validated. These conclusions can provide a theoretical basis for the design of traffic safety and management.},

@article{Montanino2015,
abstract = {This paper shows that the behavior of driver models, either individually or entangled in stochastic traffic simulation, is affected by the accuracy of empirical vehicle trajectories. To this aim, a “traffic-informed” methodology is proposed to restore physical and platoon integrity of trajectories in a finite time–space domain, and it is applied to one NGSIM I80 dataset. However, as the actual trajectories are unknown, it is not possible to verify directly whether the reconstructed trajectories are really “nearer” to the actual unknowns than the original measurements. Therefore, a simulation-based validation framework is proposed, that is also able to verify indirectly the efficacy of the reconstruction methodology. The framework exploits the main feature of NGSIM-like data that is the concurrent view of individual driving behaviors and emerging macroscopic traffic patterns. It allows showing that, at the scale of individual models, the accuracy of trajectories affects the distribution and the correlation structure of lane-changing model parameters (i.e. drivers heterogeneity), while it has very little impact on car-following calibration. At the scale of traffic simulation, when models interact in trace-driven simulation of the I80 scenario (multi-lane heterogeneous traffic), their ability to reproduce the observed macroscopic congested patterns is sensibly higher when model parameters from reconstructed trajectories are applied. These results are mainly due to lane changing, and are also the sought indirect validation of the proposed data reconstruction methodology.},

abstract = {The Action Point theory is one of the paradigms that can be applied to understand and reproduce car-following behaviour. Several different approaches to this theory have been proposed, some more simple and others more complex. In particular, the reference point in this field is still the paradigm from Wiedemann, which requires the identification of four action-point thresholds. In this paper we review Action Point theories in order to highlight similarities and differences and to ascertain whether all the thresholds proposed by Wiedemann actually bind the driving behaviour. Based on a large-scale experiment in which car-following data were collected, we identified all candidate action points assuming that the more complex (four-threshold) theory holds. Then we tested these points with respect to the large data set of available observations, in order to check whether actual actions are performed at the points. The results show that very often simpler approaches better match the observed data and that in order to explain car-following behaviour it is sufficient in most cases to refer to two thresholds. The results obtained by real-world observation were also tested in virtual environments (two different kinds of driving simulators) and were confirmed.},

abstract = {The lane-changing model is an important component within microscopic traffic simulation tools. Following the emergence of these tools in recent years, interest in the development of more reliable lane-changing models has increased. Lane-changing behavior is also important in several other applications such as capacity analysis and safety studies. Lane-changing behavior is usually modeled in two steps: (a) the decision to consider a lane change, and (b) the decision to execute the lane change. In most models, lane changes are classified as either mandatory (MLC) or discretionary (DLC). MLC are performed when the driver must leave the current lane. DLC are performed to improve driving conditions. Gap acceptance models are used to model the execution of lane changes. The classification of lane changes as either mandatory or discretionary prohibits capturing trade-offs between these considerations. The result is a rigid behavioral structure that does not permit, for example, overtaking when mandatory considerations are active. Using these models within a microsimulator may result in unrealistic traffic flow characteristics. In addition, little empirical work has been done to rigorously estimate the parameters of lane-changing models. An integrated lane-changing model, which allows drivers to jointly consider mandatory and discretionary considerations, is presented. Parameters of the model are estimated with detailed vehicle trajectory data.},

For the purposes of our analyses, we used micro-level data obtained through a recent Internet-survey that was conducted in the Census Metropolitan Area of Hamilton, Canada. We find that household life-cycle stage, socio-economic factors, mixed density at the traffic analysis zone level and land-use diversity within walking distance from the place of residence influence households' decision on how many vehicles to own. The results can be used to advise the design of planning policies aiming at controlling the effects of excessive car ownership and mobility.},

Last year, almost 25 700 people did not make it home ; more than 200 000 people came home with life-changing, serious injuries. Every fatal or serious crash on our roads is a tragedy. It is our moral obligation - our shared responsibility - to take road safety seriously. Road safety is also one of the big European success stories. In 2014, there were 5 700 fewer deaths than in 2010. In the year 2000, very few Member States had a fatality rate lower than 80 deaths per million inhabitants. By 2014, only five Member States had a fatality rate above that. This is an amazing result, and it is the result of hard and dedicated road safety work throughout the European Union. This does not mean we can now sit back and relax. The work we still have ahead is challenging. How can we make the most out of modern technologies for safety? What innovative ideas are there for the safety of the most vulnerable road users? And how to continue mobilising Member States and local stakeholders for the day-to-day work on the ground?

The current state of practice considers PRT and the deceleration level deterministic and uses of constant values for them. The state of practice ignores the differences in PRT and deceleration level between individual drivers approaching the same intersection at the onset of yellow. The research presented in this paper uses data collected from two controlled field experiments on the Smart Road at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) to model brake PRT and the deceleration level at the onset of a yellow indication for different roadway surface conditions. The paper uses many of the recent stat of art machine learning to train models that can be used to predict the brake PRT and deceleration level of approaching driver.},

abstract = {Microsimulation modelling is a tool used by practitioners and researchers to predict and evaluate the flow of traffic on real transportation networks. These models are used in practice to inform decisions and thus must reflect a high level of accuracy. Microsimulation models are comprised of sub-models, which control individual vehicle movements throughout the simulated network. These sub-models must be calibrated to accurately reflect realistic actions of drivers. This research utilizes data collected by the FHWA Living Laboratory instrumented research vehicle (IRV) to produce evidence of global trends in car-following behavior. Unlike similar studies, this analysis focuses on the physical action taken by the driver—the acceleration—rather than the outcome of that action—speed selection or time/distance gap. This approach enables better interpretation and comparison between car-following behavior on different functional classifications of roadways, operational conditions (i.e. work zone or non-work zone interstate segment), and traffic conditions. This analysis produces conclusive evidence that car-following behavior is heterogeneous and is a function of the prevailing driving environment—functional classification, operational condition, and traffic conditions of a roadway. Global trends in acceleration behaviors between different road types and traffic conditions are discussed and a statistical analysis identifies regions of significant driver acceleration behavior differences. Due to the nature of the applied IRV data, car-following behavior in work zones and non-work zones were compared and evidence of driving behavior differences—in terms of car-following acceleration behavior—was verified.},

abstract = {The impact that large trucks have on accident severity has long been a concern in the accident analysis literature. One important measure of accident severity is the most severely injured occupant in the vehicle. Such data are routinely collected in state accident data files in the U.S. Among the many risk factors that determine the most severe level of injury sustained by vehicle occupants, the number of occupants in the vehicle is an important factor. These effects can be significant because vehicles with higher occupancies have an increased likelihood of having someone seriously injured. This paper studies the occupancy/injury severity relationship using Washington State accident data. The effects of large trucks, which are shown to have a significant impact on the most severely injured vehicle occupant, are accounted for by separately estimating nested logit models for truck-involved accidents and for non-truck-involved accidents. The estimation results uncover important relationships between various risk factors and occupant injury. In addition, by comparing the accident characteristics between truck-involved accidents and non-truck-involved accidents, the risk factors unique to large trucks are identified along with the relative importance of such factors. The findings of this study demonstrate that nested logit modeling, which is able to take into account vehicle occupancy effects and identify a broad range of factors that influence occupant injury, is a promising methodological approach.},

abstract = {Driver behaviors, particularly lane-changing behaviors, have an important effect on the safety and throughput of the roadway-vehicle-based transportation system. Lane-changing models are a vital component of various microscopic traffic simulation tools, which are extensively used and playing an increasingly important role in Intelligent Transportation Systems studies. The authors conducted a detailed review and systematic comparison of existing microscopic lane-changing models that are related to roadway traffic simulation to provide a better understanding of respective properties, including strengths and weaknesses of the lane-changing models, and to identify potential for model improvement using existing and emerging data collection technologies. Many models have been developed in the last few decades to capture the uncertainty in lane change modeling; however, lane-changing behavior in the real world is very complex due to driver distraction (e.g., texting and cellphone or smartphone use) and environmental (e.g., pavement and lighting conditions) and geometric (e.g., horizontal and vertical curves) factors of the roadway, which have not been adequately considered in existing models. Therefore, large and detailed microscopic vehicle trajectory data sets are needed to develop new lane changing models that address these issues, and to calibrate and validate lane-changing models for representing the real world reliably. Possible measures to improve the accuracy and reliability of lane-changing models are also discussed in this paper.  2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This chapter describes a wide variety of exponential behavior models, including population growth, radioactive decay, charging and discharging of capacitors, inflation and interest, and armies at war. The rate of change of a variable, whether positive (as it grows) or negative (as it decays), is directly proportional to the immediate value of that variable. More often than not, the rate of change is a time rate of change that is proportional to the variable's instantaneous value. Similar exponential decays also occur spatially, that is, with respect to a spatial coordinate. Behaviors decay over some distance so as to have little or no effect at distances sufficiently far from the initiating behavior. Exponential models are ubiquitous and have many applications in physics, finance, and population and resource predictions. The primary characteristic of exponential growth or decay of a population is the dependence of the rate of growth of the population on its size at any instant. The population growth and projections improve based on an elementary exponential model in which the population growth rate is linearly or directly proportional to the current size of the population.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown the effect of a lead vehicle's speed, deceleration rate and headway distance on drivers' brake response times. However, how drivers perceive this information and use it to determine when to apply braking is still not quite clear. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, a driving simulator experiment was performed where each participant experienced nine deceleration scenarios. Previously reported effects of the lead vehicle's speed, deceleration rate and headway distance on brake response time were firstly verified in this paper, using a multilevel model. Then, as an alternative to measures of speed, deceleration rate and distance, two visual looming-based metrics (angular expansion rate $\theta$˙ of the lead vehicle on the driver's retina, and inverse tau $\tau$-1, the ratio between $\theta$˙ and the optical size $\theta$), considered to be more in line with typical human psycho-perceptual responses, were adopted to quantify situation urgency. These metrics were used in two previously proposed mechanistic models predicting brake onset: either when looming surpasses a threshold, or when the accumulated evidence (looming and other cues) reaches a threshold. Results showed that the looming threshold model did not capture the distribution of brake response time. However, regardless of looming metric, the accumulator models fitted the distribution of brake response times better than the pure threshold models. Accumulator models, including brake lights, provided a better model fit than looming-only versions. For all versions of the mechanistic models, models using $\tau$-1as the measure of looming fitted better than those using $\theta$˙, indicating that the visual cues drivers used during rear-end collision avoidance may be more close to $\tau$-1.},

abstract = {This study compared the effects of three doses of cannabis and alcohol (placebo, low and high doses), both alone and in combination, on the driving performance of young, novice drivers and more experienced drivers. Alcohol was administered as ethanol (95{\%}) mixed with orange juice in doses of approximately 0, 0.4 and 0.6g/kg. Cannabis was administered by inhalation of smoke from pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes (supplied by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, USA). Active cigarettes contained 19 mg delta-9-THC. Using a counterbalanced design, the simulated driving performance of 25 experienced and 22 inexperienced drivers was tested under the nine different drug conditions in an arterial driving environment during which workload was varied through the drive characteristics as well as through the inclusion of a secondary task. High levels of cannabis generally induced greater impairment than lower levels, while alcohol at the doses used had few effects and did not produce synergistic effects when combined with cannabis. Both cannabis and alcohol were associated with increases in speed and lateral position variability, high dose cannabis was associated with decreased mean speed, increased mean and variability in headways, and longer reaction time, while in contrast alcohol was associated with a slight increase in mean speed. Given the limitations of the study, it is of great interest to further explore the qualitative impairments in driving performance associated with cannabis and alcohol separately and how these impairments may manifest in terms of crash characteristics.},

The main assumption in these models is that the behavior of the following vehicle (e.g., change in acceleration) is related directly to a stimulus observed or perceived by the driver, defined relative to the lead vehicle (e.g., difference in speeds or headways). An important aspect missing from previous formulations pertains to the stochastic character of the cognitive processes used by drivers, such as perception, judgment, and execution while driving. A car-following model that reflects the psychological and cognitive aspects of the phenomenon and captures risk-taking behavior under uncertainty is explored and evaluated. In this model, Tversky and Kahneman's prospect theory provides a theoretical and operational basis for weighing a driver's different alternatives. The model is implemented and tested to assess its properties and those of the resulting traffic stream behavior.},

It describes macroscopic models that predict the average variables of traffic density and traffic flow rates because they are very important for calculating the capacity of roads and highways. Traffic flow, in mathematics and civil engineering, is the study of interactions between vehicles, drivers, and infrastructure with the aim of understanding and developing an optimal road network with efficient movement of traffic and minimal traffic congestion problems. The macroscopic modeling of traffic assumes a sufficiently large number of cars in a lane or on a road such that each stream of autos can be treated as fluid flowing in a tube or stream. On the other hand, microscopic models predict how speed varies with driver sensitivities and responses to various traffic stimuli because they provide a basis for obtaining the gross traffic density and flow rates needed in macroscopic models. These models are being increasingly used to investigate the control of individual vehicles, as well as lines (or lanes) of vehicles.},

To understand the driving behavior in the car-following stage more clearly, the collected time series were classified into a number of regimes using unsupervised fuzzy clustering methods. Then, the statistical relations between the driver acceleration response and the perceptual variables in each regime were analyzed using correlation and regression methods. It was found that regime classification helps discern the behavioral variance between those regime clusters. According to the data analysis, some of the car-following regimes, for example, opening and braking, can be described adequately in the statistical sense by a linear regression model (Helly{\{}{\^{a}}{\}}€{\{}$\backslash$texttrademark{\}}s model).

Statistics show that the observed headways follow a certain log-normal type distribution within each preselected velocity range. To explain this phenomenon, an asymmetric stochastic extension of the Tau Theory is proposed. This novel approach assumes that the observed headway distributions are due to drivers' continuous headway adjustment behaviours, and that the intensity of headway change is proportional to headway magnitude. The agreement between the model predictions and the empirical observations indicates that driving behaviours may be implicitly governed by the physiological Tau characteristics of drivers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Visual angle car following models have previously been proposed in modeling drivers' "close following" behavior particularly in traffic simulation models. These models use relative speeds and relative spacings between successive vehicles, but they are unique in including the width of vehicles when determining the safe distance between the leading vehicle and its follower. This paper focuses on examining the validity of the visual angle model assumptions; especially the ability of such models in representing the effect of heavy goods vehicles, when such models are used in traffic simulation applications. Two types of data have been used for this purpose. Published real traffic data from instrumented vehicles (both from the USA and Germany) have been used to check the capability of these models to replicate real traffic movements but only when both leading and following vehicles are considered to be "small cars". Another type of data has been used based on two motorway sections in the UK, namely the M25 (London outer ring road) and a section of the M42 "Managed Motorway" (Birmingham outer ring road). Over 4 million cases of individual vehicles have been abstracted from inductive loop detectors installed on these motorways. The sets of data were then filtered and analyzed to examine the following distance according to the type of leading vehicles (i.e. "cars" or heavy goods vehicles - "HGVs"). The results showed that while visual angle car following models may successfully replicate real traffic movements based on the instrumented vehicles data from Germany and the USA, the assumption of leaving larger following distance if the leader is an HGV is found to be not the case for the majority of UK drivers. This will have a negative impact on the ability to use visual angle car following simulation models to represent UK real traffic behavior. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In so doing, the studys findings contribute to pressing policy issues such as social exclusion. Seven counties of the Louisville, KY-IN MSA serve as the study area for the investigation. Data are derived from three sources: a geocoded travel diary survey that was conducted in the study area in 2000, a geocoded database of all urban opportunities in the study area, and a database containing shortest path travel times between the locations of households and urban opportunities. Accessibility indices (i.e., gravity, cumulative opportunity, and proximity) are computed for households found in the trip diary survey. Furthermore, these indices are defined for 34 types of opportunities: four aggregate types (i.e., retail, service, leisure, and religious) and 30 disaggregate types representing the 10 most popular destinations for trips for each of the first three aggregate types. Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests are used to compare the accessibilities of five socio-economic groups (i.e., individuals residing in rural communities, individuals residing in single-person and single-parent households, individuals residing in low-income households, women, and the elderly) to their counterparts. Except for individuals residing in rural areas, our findings indicate that groups, which conventional wisdom would suggest are at risk of social exclusion, are not disadvantaged in terms of accessibility.},

abstract = {Driver PT is critical when a driver faces an imminent crash risk and needs to determine what evasive maneuvers to execute. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study how PT varies across different critical driving situations. PT refers to the time drivers need to recognize the nature and significance of external stimuli. Driver PT is critical when he or she faces a potentially hazardous driving situation, and must determine what action(s) or evasive maneuver(s) to execute. Although past research has identified many factors associated with PT, little research has been done on the effects of critical driving situations on PT, let alone in a real-world driving environment. Naturalistic driving study (NDS) data provides an unprecedented opportunity to look into PT prior to the occurrence of safety-related events. This study seeks to shed light on how critical driving situations influence driver PT, as well as how the driving environment and driver behavior affect PT during real-world driving by utilizing the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) NDS data. An NDS consists of two primary features that distinguish it from retrospective approaches: vehicles are equipped with video camera technologies that observe the driver and the road ahead of the vehicle continuously while driving, and drivers are asked to drive as they normally would. To best study PT while minimizing the effects of confounding factors, this study focused on a total of 1417 rear-end crashes and near crashes. It was found that critical driving situations, the driving environment, and driver behavior are all influential factors in explaining the variation of PT among different drivers. The longest PTs are during critical driving situations where the vehicle ahead is stop-and-go, which can be as long as 2.84 s while controlling for the effects of driving environment and driver behavior factors, compared to other types of driving situations such as a vehicle ahead decelerating or lane changing.},

abstract = {The NGSIM trajectory data sets provide longitudinal and lateral positional information for all vehicles in certain spatiotemporal regions. Velocity and acceleration information cannot be extracted directly since the noise in the NGSIM positional information is greatly increased by the necessary numerical differentiations. We propose a smoothing algorithm for positions, velocities and accelerations that can also be applied near the boundaries. The smoothing time interval is estimated based on velocity time series and the variance of the processed acceleration time series. The velocity information obtained in this way is then applied to calculate the density function of the two-dimensional distribution of velocity and inverse distance, and the density of the distribution corresponding to the ``microscopic'' fundamental diagram. Furthermore, it is used to calculate the distributions of time gaps and times-to-collision, conditioned to several ranges of velocities and velocity differences. By simulating virtual stationary detectors we show that the probability for critical values of the times-to-collision is greatly underestimated when estimated from single-vehicle data of stationary detectors. Finally, we investigate the lane-changing process and formulate a quantitative criterion for the duration of lane changes that is based on the trajectory density in normalized coordinates. Remarkably, there is a very noisy but significant velocity advantage in favor of the targeted lane that decreases immediately before the change due to anticipatory accelerations.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the simple harmonic oscillator, with and without damping, with and without a forcing function, and in several different guises. These applications include the classical mechanical spring-mass system, inductor-capacitor oscillators, a parallel resistor–inductor–capacitor (RLC) circuit, the vibration of tall buildings, and oscillation in a cyclotron and of a vehicle suspension system. The electrical–mechanical analogy is useful to define the different terms in the various oscillator models. Forced vibration occurs when there is a persistent, repetitive input, such as the kind an air conditioning system imparts to the building it cools. The forced harmonic vibration of an oscillator involves the very important concepts of resonance and impedance. In impedance, the various elements (spring, mass, and damper) provide different response regimes, that is, frequency regimes that are controlled, respectively, by stiffness, mass, and damping. For the development of oscillatory behavior, systems must have elements with stiffness that store potential energy (springs and capacitors), elements with mass that store kinetic energy (masses and inductors), and elements that dissipate energy (dashpots and resistors). Stiffness may take many forms, but there must always be an element that stores potential energy in order for there to be an exchange with an element that stores kinetic energy.},

abstract = {Driver braking behavior was analyzed using time-series recordings from naturalistic rear-end conflicts (116 crashes and 241 near-crashes), including events with and without visual distraction among drivers of cars, heavy trucks, and buses. A simple piecewise linear model could be successfully fitted, per event, to the observed driver decelerations, allowing a detailed elucidation of when drivers initiated braking and how they controlled it. Most notably, it was found that, across vehicle types, driver braking behavior was strongly dependent on the urgency of the given rear-end scenario's kinematics, quantified in terms of visual looming of the lead vehicle on the driver's retina. In contrast with previous suggestions of brake reaction times (BRTs) of 1.5 s or more after onset of an unexpected hazard (e.g., brake light onset), it was found here that braking could be described as typically starting less than a second after the kinematic urgency reached certain threshold levels, with even faster reactions at higher urgencies. The rate at which drivers then increased their deceleration (towards a maximum) was also highly dependent on urgency. Probability distributions are provided that quantitatively capture these various patterns of kinematics-dependent behavioral response. Possible underlying mechanisms are suggested, including looming response thresholds and neural evidence accumulation. These accounts argue that a naturalistic braking response should not be thought of as a slow reaction to some single, researcher-defined “hazard onset”, but instead as a relatively fast response to the visual looming cues that build up later on in the evolving traffic scenario.},

abstract = {Many car-following models predict a stable car-following behavior with a very small fluctuation around an equilibrium value g* of the net headway g with zero speed-difference ??v between the following and the lead vehicle. However, it is well-known and additionally demonstrated by data in this paper, that the fluctuations are much larger than these models predict. Typically, the fluctuation in speed difference is around ??2m/s, while the fluctuation in the net time headway T=g/v can be as big as one or even two seconds, which is as large as the mean time headway itself. By analyzing data from loop detectors as well as data from vehicle trajectories, evidence is provided that this randomness is not due to driver heterogeneity, but can be attributed to an internal stochasticity of the driver itself. A final model-based analysis supports the hypothesis, that the preferred headway of the driver is the parameter that is not kept constant but fluctuates strongly, thus causing the even macroscopically observable randomness in traffic flow. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A structure is proposed to connect the decisions which a driver has to make before changing lanes. The model is intended to cover the urban driving situation, where traffic signals, obstructions and heavy vehicles all exert an influence. The structure is designed to ensure that the vehicles in traffic simulations behave logically when confronted with situations commonly encountered in real traffic. The specific mathematical expression of the questions embedded in the decision process and employed in the present implementation of the model are not critical and can be replaced by alternatives, but the heirarchy of the decisions is crucial. On the basis of experience to date, the lane changing model produces a realistic simulation of driver behaviour and has proved very robust under a wide range of conditions.},

abstract = {Interest in calibration of car-following models by using real-life micro- scopic trajectory data is increasing. However, more information is needed on the influence of methodological issues on calibration results as well as on the influence of practical issues related to the use of real-life data. In particular, the influence of measurement errors on parameter estimates has not yet been considered in detail. To gain insight into the influence of measurement errors on calibration results, synthetic data were created to which several types of measurement error are introduced. These data are input to a validated calibration procedure, after which it is studied how well the parameters used for creating the data can be identified from the erroneous data. The sensitivity of the objective function to small changes in the optimal parameters also is assessed. The calibrations are repeated by using different variables in the objec- tive. The three main findings are that (a) measurement errors can yield a considerable bias in the estimation results, (b) parameters minimizing the objective function do not necessarily capture following dynamics best, and (c) measurement errors substantially reduce the sensitivity of the objective function and consequently reduce the reliability of esti- mation results. The extent to which these problems caused by mea- surement errors can be avoided by smoothing the data carefully before use is assessed and discussed.},

abstract = {As the use of in-vehicle technologies became more popular, there is concern about a concomitant increase in driver distraction arising from their use. While the introduction of voice recognition systems is intended to reduce the distraction due to manual operation of these units, a significant proportion of the distraction associated with their use may arise not from the manual manipulation but rather the cognitive consequences. It is also known that the risk of inattentive driving varies with age. In this study, the impact of cognitive workload and traffic environments on older drivers' behavior was investigated in a driving simulator. To assess the impact of advancing age on driving performance degradation under a dual task condition, the performance of 63 drivers, divided into younger (20–29) and older (60–69) age groups, was evaluated. The authors also considered driving behavioral differences in the context of urban and highway driving, appropriately counterbalanced. At a specified location in the two scenarios, subjects were asked to complete a series of auditory tasks of increasing complexity. Comparisons of younger and older drivers' driving performance, including forward velocity, speed control, standard deviation of lane position and steering wheel reversal rate, were conducted. Results indicated that age and traffic environment impact both driving performance and compensatory behavior during dual task conditions.},

In this paper concerns are expressed about the role accorded to individual travellers and the wider space-time context of cities in the empirical-analytical work by Kenworthy and colleagues. To investigate the seriousness of these concerns, the data collected by Kenworthy and colleagues for European, Canadian and US cities in 1990 have been augmented with information on housing, urban development history and the sociodemographic situation. Regression models are described in which the role of urban form is investigated while account is taken of other relevant factors. The empirical analysis suggests that the space-time context of cities should be taken into account in aggregate-level comparisons of the relations between urban form and transport. Policy recommendations based on the original data may be reconsidered and tailored to the space-time context and population characteristics of cities.},

abstract = {Recent studies have provided that the vehicle trajectories generated by car-following models may not represent the real driving characteristics, thus leading to significant emission estimation errors. In this paper, two of the most widely used car-following models, Wiedemann and Fritzsche models, were selected and analyzed based on the massive field car-following trajectories in Beijing. A numerical simulation method was designed to generate the following car's trajectories by using the field trajectories as the input. By comparing the simulated and the filed data, the representativeness of the simulated regime fractions and VSP distributions were evaluated. Then, the mechanism of car-following models was investigated from the aspects of regime determination and the acceleration rule in each regime. Further, the regime threshold parameters and acceleration model were optimized for emission estimations. This study found that the “Following” regime threshold of SDX and the maximum acceleration in “Free Driving” regime are critical parameters for Wiedemann model. The differences between the Wiedemann simulated VSP distribution and the field one can be reduced separately by applying the optimized SDX and maximum acceleration model individually. However, a much sharper reduction was observed by optimizing both parameters simultaneously, and the emission estimation errors were further reduced, which were less than 4{\%} in the case studies. Fritzsche model generated more realistic VSP distributions and emissions, while the maximum accelerations could be further optimized for high speed conditions.},

Previous research has shown that drivers' expectations can impact RT when facing hazardous situations, but driving with advanced driver assistance systems, can change the way BRT are considered. The interaction with a collision warning system can help faster more efficient responses, but at the same time can require a monitoring task and evaluation process that may lead to automation complacency. The aims of the present study are to test in a real-life setting whether automation compliancy can be generated by a collision warning system and what component of expectancy can impact the different tasks involved in an assisted BRT process.

Results supply indication on perception time and mental elaboration of the collision warning system alerts. In particular reliable warning quickened the decision making process, misleading warnings generated automation complacency slowing visual search for hazard detection, lack of directed experienced slowed the overall response while unexpected failure of the device lead to inattentional blindness and potential pseudo-accidents with surprise obstacle intrusion.},

The most outstanding account for precise timing has been the tau hypothesis. However, recent studies demonstrate that tau is not the only source of information in judging time-to-contact. By measuring reaction time in a time-to-contact discrimination task, we show that the $\eta$ function, which is a specific combination of optical size and rate of expansion, explains both accuracy and the observed RT pattern. The results conform to the hypothesis that the observers initiate the response when $\eta$ reaches a response threshold value. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The need to detect and process looming remains critically important for humans in everyday life. Road traffic statistics confirm that children up to 15 years old are overrepresented in pedestrian casualties. We demonstrate that, for a given pedestrian crossing time, vehicles traveling faster loom less than slower vehicles, which creates a dangerous illusion in which faster vehicles may be perceived as not approaching. Our results from perceptual tests of looming thresholds show strong developmental trends in sensitivity, such that children may not be able to detect vehicles approaching at speeds in excess of 20 mph. This creates a risk of injudicious road crossing in urban settings when traffic speeds are higher than 20 mph. The risk is exacerbated because vehicles moving faster than this speed are more likely to result in pedestrian fatalities.},

abstract = {The academic literature on the impact of urban form on travel behavior has increasingly recognized that residential location choice and travel choices may be interconnected. We contribute to the understanding of this interrelation by studying to what extent commute mode choice differs by residential neighborhood and by neighborhood type dissonance—the mismatch between a commuter's current neighborhood type and her preferences regarding physical attributes of the residential neighborhood. Using data from the San Francisco Bay Area, we find that neighborhood type dissonance is statistically significantly associated with commute mode choice: dissonant urban residents are more likely to commute by private vehicle than consonant urbanites but not quite as likely as true suburbanites. However, differences between neighborhoods tend to be larger than between consonant and dissonant residents within a neighborhood. Physical neighborhood structure thus appears to have an autonomous impact on commute mode choice. The analysis also shows that the impact of neighborhood type dissonance interacts with that of commuters' beliefs about automobile use, suggesting that these are to be reckoned with when studying the joint choices of residential location and commute mode.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of two new mathematical models of driver behavior in single-lane car following situations. Optimum parameter values in each of these models were obtained using standard parameter identification algorithms. The basic approach to model development was to derive the model structure using optimal control theory. The problem was formulated as a model-tracking problem and a quadratic cost function was minimized. Model parameters were optimized by comparing model behavior with freeway data obtained on Interstate 71 in Ohio by Clear and Treiterer. The results indicate that the models fit the data very well during acceleration and deceleration phases, but not during constant velocity regions. To obtain a better fit during transitions between acceleration and deceleration phases, a second model was postulated based on the hypothesis that the driver tracks not only the car directly in front of him, but also cars directly ahead of the lead car. An adaptive controller structure with a mode switching algorithm has been derived and its parameters optimized.},

Moreover, spectrum analysis methods based on Fourier analysis of car-following data are introduced to estimate driver reaction times, a crucial parameter of driver behavior. A generalized general motor-type model was calibrated, an extension of the classic nonlinear general motor model, in a stable following regime based on estimated driver reaction times.

abstract = {The paper reports on a validation study of the interactive fixed-base driving simulator of Inter-University Research Center for Road Safety (CRISS) that was effectuated in order to verify the CRISS driving simulator's usefulness at a tool for speed research on two-lane rural roads. Speeds were recorded at eleven measurement sites with different alignment configurations on a two-lane rural road near Rome. The real world was reproduced in the CRISS driving simulator. Forty drivers drove the simulator. The results of the comparative and statistical analysis established the relative validity and also revealed that absolute validity was obtained in nine measurements sites. Only in two non-demanding configurations, were the speeds in simulator significantly higher than those recorded in the field. In these sites the mean speed in simulator was equal to or greater than 94 km/h. For these configurations, the higher speeds recorded in simulator appeared to stem from the different risk perception on the simulated road as opposed to that on the real road. The study's results should be considered for driving speed behavior research, in which simulator equipment with similar features of the CRISS driving simulator is used. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective is to assign objects with a similar intrinsic interaction pattern to a common cluster. To formalize this idea, we define a cluster by a set of mathematical models describing the cluster-specific interaction pattern. In addition, we propose interaction K-means (IKM), an efficient algorithm for partitioning clustering of multivariate time series. The cluster-specific interaction patterns detected by IKM provide valuable information for interpretation of the cluster content. An extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic and real world data demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

abstract = {Traffic flow oscillations, including traffic waves, are a common yet incompletely understood feature of congested traffic. Possible mechanisms include traffic flow instabilities, indifference regions or finite human perception thresholds (action points), and external acceleration noise. However, the relative importance of these factors in a given situation remains unclear. We bring light into this question by adding external noise and action points to the Intelligent Driver Model and other car-following models thereby obtaining a minimal model containing all three oscillation mechanisms. We show analytically that even in the subcritical regime of linearly stable flow (order parameter ϵ {\textless} 0), external white noise leads to spatiotemporal speed correlations «anticipating» the waves of the linearly unstable regime. Sufficiently far away from the threshold, the amplitude scales with (-ϵ)-0.5. By means of simulations and comparisons with experimental car platoons and bicycle traffic, we show that external noise and indifference regions with action points have essentially equivalent effects. Furthermore, flow instabilities dominate the oscillations on freeways while external noise or action points prevail at low desired speeds such as vehicular city or bicycle traffic. For bicycle traffic, noise can lead to fully developed waves even for single-file traffic in the subcritical regime.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine whether size of a lead vehicle (passenger car or light truck) affects the distance at which following vehicles travel. Naturalistic following data were collected from drivers using instrumented passenger cars in place of their own vehicles. The results show that these drivers followed light trucks at shorter distances than they followed other passenger cars by an average of 5.6 m, or .19 s in headway time margin, but at the same velocities and range-rates. This result is discussed in the context of a passenger car driver's ability to see beyond a lead vehicle to assess, and respond to, the status of traffic downstream. The results of this study suggest that knowing the state of traffic beyond the lead vehicle, even by only one additional vehicle, affects gap length. Specifically, it appears that when dimensions of lead vehicles permit other drivers to see through, over, or around them, drivers maintain significantly longer (i.e., safer) distances.},

abstract = {Car following models have been studied with many diverse approaches for decades. Nowadays, technological advances have significantly improved our traffic data collection capabilities. Conventional car following models rely on mathematical formulas and are derived from traffic flow theory; a property that often makes them more restrictive. On the other hand, data-driven approaches are more flexible and allow the incorporation of additional information to the model; however, they may not provide as much insight into traffic flow theory as the traditional models. In this research, an innovative methodological framework based on a data-driven approach is proposed for the estimation of car-following models, suitable for incorporation into microscopic traffic simulation models. An existing technique, i.e. locally weighted regression (loess), is defined through an optimization problem and is employed in a novel way. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using data collected from a sequence of instrumented vehicles in Naples, Italy. Gipps' model, one of the most extensively used car-following models, is calibrated against the same data and used as a reference benchmark. Optimization issues are raised in both cases. The obtained results suggest that data-driven car-following models could be a promising research direction.},

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

abstract = {This paper will report findings of an instrumented vehicle study aimed at assessing one element of driver behaviour, that of car following, on UK motorways. The paper (re-) calibrates one of the most successful of such models-the Action Point model-using dynamic time series data acquired from field tests with an instrumented vehicle. Probability distributions for a number of parameters from the Action Point model are produced and a number of modifications made in order to enhance its value for use in traffic flow and simulation models. Lastly typical headways are compared with existing studies in the area, finding that current headways are far lower than believed. The rationale behind the adoption of such short headways is examined. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Calibrated simulation models taking into account adverse weather conditions can be used to optimise traffic management strategies, such as speed adaptation and signal timing optimisation. On snowy road conditions, car-following behaviour changes because drivers tend to accelerate more slowly, increase their following distance and drive with lower speeds. Such changes results in lower saturation flow rates at intersections. In order to simulate traffic on snowy road conditions in a valid way, the parameters of a simulation have to be calibrated for adverse weather. This study identifies the parameters of the car-following model in the microscopic simulator VISSIM that are sensitive to snowy road conditions and indicates valid parameter subspaces leading to a good match of simulation model output with observed saturation flow rates and start-up delays. In combination with green time of a signalised intersection, saturation flow rate is essential for correctly estimating road capacity. 1},

The ecp package is designed to perform multiple change point analysis while making as few assumptions as possible. While many other change point methods are applicable only for univariate data, this R package is suitable for both univariate and multivariate observations. Estimation can be based upon either a hierarchical divisive or agglomerative algorithm. Divisive estimation sequentially identifies change points via a bisection algorithm. The agglomerative algorithm estimates change point locations by determining an optimal segmentation. Both approaches are able to detect any type of distributional change within the data. This provides an advantage over many existing change point algorithms which are only able to detect changes within the marginal distributions.},

In the present paper the remits of a number of other field, simulator, and laboratory experiments to investigate sensitivity to relative motion reported in the literature are examined in the light of these analytical response functions. It is shown that this approach leads to a relatively consistent interpretation of most of the available data, and that, when appropriately interpreted, there is greater agreement between many of the experimental results than had hitherto been noted.},

@article{Xin2008a,
abstract = {In this paper a new behavioral car-following model is presented. Unlike traditional car-following models which preclude vehicle collisions, the proposed model aims to emulate " less-then-perfect " everyday driving, while striving to capture both safe and unsafe driver behavior. Most importantly, a realistic perception-response process is incorporated with the model based on developments from visual perception studies. In particular, driver inattention is characterized by a driver-specific variable called scanning interval. This variable when coupled with the driver's visual perception-response process, actually results in variable reaction times that are not only dependent on each driver's individual characteristics, but also on instantaneous traffic conditions such as speed and density. This enables closer emulation of real life human driving and its interactions with surrounding vehicles. Stated otherwise, both inter-and intra-driver variations in reaction time are captured in a plausible and coherent manner, while in earlier studies, reaction time is either presumed fixed, or of limited variability. Furthermore, parameters of this model have a direct physical and behavioral meaning; this implies that vehicle collisions, if any, can be analyzed with respect to behavioral patterns rather than simply being treated as numerical artifacts. In all, 54 detailed and accurate vehicle trajectories extracted from 10 real life crashes were employed to test the model's capability of replicating freeway rear-end collisions. In addition high resolution crash-free trajectory data were employed to validate the model against normal driving behavior. Test results indicate that the proposed model is able to replicate both normal as well as unsafe driving behavior that could lead to vehicle collisions. Finally, the feasibility of integrating the proposed model with existing micro-simulators is briefly discussed. The outcome of this work can eventually facilitate studying crash mechanisms at a high definition microscopic level as well as enabling safety-related system design improvements and evaluation through micro-simulation software.},

The brake lights of the lead car were either working normally or switched off. The results indicated that the detection of the lead car's brake lights, in daylight, is substantially impaired when a following driver is looking at the speedometer area and brake lights do not contribute to detection at all when he/she is looking at a target in the mid-console. Driving experience did not influence performance in detecting a closing headway in peripheral vision, in contrast to improvement in lane-keeping found in an earlier study. It is suggested that such differential ability in using peripheral vision for lane and distance-keeping may mislead experienced drivers when they follow another vehicle and perform certain in-car tasks. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Hale2014,
abstract = {Use of traffic simulation has increased in recent decades; and this high-fidelity modelling, along with moving vehicle animation, has allowed transportation decisions to be made with better confidence. During this time, traffic engineers have been encouraged to embrace the process of calibration, in which steps are taken to reconcile simulated and field-observed performance. According to international surveys, experts, and conventional wisdom, existing (non-automated) methods of calibration have been difficult or inadequate. There has been extensive research on improved calibration methods, but many of these efforts have not produced the flexibility and practicality required by real-world engineers. With this in mind, a patent-pending (US 61/859,819) architecture for software-assisted calibration was developed to maximize practicality, flexibility, and ease-of-use. This architecture is called SASCO (i.e. Sensitivity Analysis, Self-Calibration, and Optimization). The original optimization method within SASCO was based on "directed brute force" (DBF) searching; performing exhaustive evaluation of alternatives in a discrete, user-defined search space. Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) has also gained favor as an efficient method for optimizing computationally expensive, "black-box" traffic simulations, and was also implemented within SASCO. This paper uses synthetic and real-world case studies to assess the qualities of DBF and SPSA, so they can be applied in the right situations. SPSA was found to be the fastest method, which is important when calibrating numerous inputs, but DBF was more reliable. Additionally DBF was better than SPSA for sensitivity analysis, and for calibrating complex inputs. Regardless of which optimization method is selected, the SASCO architecture appears to offer a new and practice-ready level of calibration efficiency.},

abstract = {Objective: This article provides a review of recent models of driver behavior in on-road collision situations. Background: In efforts to improve traffic safety, computer simulation of accident situations holds promise as a valuable tool, for both academia and industry. However, to ensure the validity of simulations, models are needed that accurately capture near-crash driver behavior, as observed in real traffic or driving experiments. Method: Scientific articles were identified by a systematic approach, including extensive database searches. Criteria for inclusion were defined and applied, including the requirement that models should have been previously applied to simulate on-road collision avoidance behavior. Several selected models were implemented and tested in selected scenarios. Results: The reviewed articles were grouped according to a rough taxonomy based on main emphasis, namely avoidance by braking, avoidance by steering, avoidance by a combination of braking and steering, effects of driver states and characteristics on avoidance, and simulation platforms. Conclusion: A large number of near-collision driver behavior models have been proposed. Validation using human driving data has often been limited, but exceptions exist. The research field appears fragmented, but simulation-based comparison indicates that there may be more similarity between models than what is apparent from the model equations. Further comparison of models is recommended. Application: This review provides traffic safety researchers with an overview of the field of driver models for collision situations. Specifically, researchers aiming to develop simulations of on-road collision accident situations can use this review to find suitable starting points for their work. {\textcopyright} 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.},

@article{DeLucia2009,
abstract = {More than 25{\%} of accidents are rear-end collisions. It is essential to identify the factors that contribute to such collisions. One such factor is a driver's ability to respond to the deceleration of the car ahead. In Experiment 1, we measured effects of optic flow information and discrete visual and auditory warnings (brake lights, tones) on responses to deceleration during car following. With computer simulations of car-following scenes, university students pressed a button when the lead car decelerated. Both classes of information affected responses. Observers relied on discrete warnings when optic flow information was relatively less effective as determined by the lead car's headway and deceleration rate. This is consistent with DeLucia's (2008) conceptual framework of space perception that emphasized the importance of viewing distance and motion (and task). In Experiment 2, we measured responses to deceleration after a visual interruption. Scenes were designed to tease apart the role of expectations and optic flow. Responses mostly were consistent with optic flow information presented after the interruption rather than with putative mental expectations that were set up by the lead car's motion prior to the interruption. The theoretical implication of the present results is that responses to deceleration are based on multiple sources of information, including optical size, optical expansion rate and tau, and discrete warnings that are independent of optic flow. The practical implication is that in-vehicle collision-avoidance warning systems may be more useful when optic flow is less effective (e.g., slow deceleration rates), implicating a role for adaptive collision-warning systems.},

abstract = {We generalize a wide class of time-continuous microscopic traffic models to include essential aspects of driver behaviour not captured by these models. Specifically, we consider (i) finite reaction times, (ii) estimation errors, (iii) looking several vehicles ahead (spatial anticipation), and (iv) temporal anticipation. The estimation errors are modelled as stochastic Wiener processes and lead to time-correlated fluctuations of the acceleration. We show that the destabilizing effects of reaction times and estimation errors can essentially be compensated for by spatial and temporal anticipation, that is, the combination of stabilizing and destabilizing effects results in the same qualitative macroscopic dynamics as that of the, respectively, underlying simple car-following model. In many cases, this justifies the use of simplified, physics-oriented models with a few parameters only. Although the qualitative dynamics is unchanged, multi-anticipation increase both spatial and temporal scales of stop-and-go waves and other complex patterns of congested traffic in agreement with real traffic data. Remarkably, the anticipation allows accident-free smooth driving in complex traffic situations even if reaction times exceed typical time headways. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Drivers' estimates of time to collision were determined in a laboratory simulation using film segments made from a following vehicle approaching a lead vehicle, which was also in motion. Headway, approach speed, and viewing time were varied to make a total of 48 conditions. It was found that, provided the angular velocity subtended by the lead vehicle was above a threshold value of about .003 radians/sec, the driver was able to give reasonable estimates of time to collision. The standard deviation of the estimates varied linearly with the time to collision. Although drivers underestimated the time to collision when it was small, the large standard deviation shows the possibility of rear-end collisions due to poor estimation of time to collision, especially when the times for control action and vehicle deceleration are considered. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The manner in which vehicles follow each other on a highway (without passing) and the propagation disturbances down a line of vehicles has been investigated. Experimental data is presented which indicates that the acceleration at time t of a car which is attempting to follow a leader is proportional to the difference in velocity of the two cars at a time (t-$\Delta$), $\Delta$ being about 1.5 sec and the proportionality constant being about 0.37 sec-1. It is shown theoretically that the motion of a long line of vehicles becomes unstable when the product of the lag time and the proportionality constant exceeds one-half. The experimental data implies that driving is done on the verge of instability. A variety of other laws of following is analyzed theoretically.},

This attention needs to be reflected upon at particular points in time. CF models are in a continuous state of improvement due to their significant role in traffic micro-simulations, intelligent transportation systems and safety engineering models. This paper presents a review of existing CF models. It classifies them into classic and artificial intel-ligence models. It discusses the capability of the models and potential limitations that need to be con-sidered in their improvement. This paper also reviews the studies investigating the impacts of heavy vehicles in traffic stream and on CF behaviour. The findings of the study provide promising directions for future research and suggest revisiting the existing models to accommodate different behaviours of drivers in heterogeneous traffic, in particular, heavy vehicles in traffic.},

abstract = {Considerable research efforts are currently being devoted to analysing the role that the attentional system plays in determining driving behaviour, with the ultimate objective of reducing the number of attention-related accidents. The present study aims to assess the influence of differences in the functioning of the three attentional networks (executive control, attentional orienting and alerting) when drivers have to deal with some common hazardous situations, for example, when an oncoming car or a pedestrian unexpectedly crosses their trajectory. Multiple measures of participants' attentional functioning were obtained from a computer-based neurocognitive test: the Attention Networks Test for Interactions and Vigilance (ANTI-V). These measures were compared to performance in a driving simulator where different types of hazardous situations were presented. Correlation and linear regression analyses revealed significant associations between individual attentional measures and driving performance in specific traffic situations. In particular, a higher attentional orienting score on the ANTI-V was associated with safer driving in situations where a single precursor anticipated the hazard source, whereas in complex situations with multiple potential hazard precursors, higher attentional orienting scores were associated with delayed braking. Additionally, partial evidence of a relationship between crash occurrence and the functioning of the executive control and the alerting networks was found. Overall, the current research would be helpful to better understand the role that each attentional network (executive control, attentional orienting and alerting) play in safe driving, and thus to develop efficient countermeasures to reduce attention-related crashes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

(iv) What improvements can be made to car-following models? and (v) Do we need a normative model of driver behavior?

abstract = {Fuel consumption or pollutant emissions can be assessed by coupling a microscopic traffic flow model with an instantaneous emission model. Traffic models are usually calibrated using goodness of fit indicators related to the traffic behavior. Thus, this paper investigates how such a calibration influences the accuracy of fuel consumption and NOx and PM estimations. Two traffic models are investigated: Newell and Gipps. It appears that the Gipps model provides the closest simulated trajectories when compared to real ones. Interestingly, a reverse ranking is observed for fuel consumption, NOx and PM emissions. For both models, the emissions of single vehicles are very sensitive to the calibration. This is confirmed by a global sensitivity analysis of the Gipps model that shows that non-optimal parameters significantly increase the variance of the outputs. Fortunately, this is no longer the case when emissions are calculated for a group of many vehicles. Indeed, the mean errors for platoons are close to 10{\%} for the Gipps model and always lower than 4{\%} for the Newell model. Another interesting property is that optimal parameters for each vehicle can be replaced by the mean values with no discrepancy for the Newell model and low discrepancies for the Gipps model when calculating the different emission outputs. Finally, this study presents preliminary results that show that multi-objective calibration methods are certainly the best direction for future works on the Gipps model. Indeed, the accuracy of vehicle emissions can be highly improved with negligible counterparts on the traffic model accuracy.},

abstract = {The paper proposes a car following model from the perspective of visual imaging (VIM), where the visual imaging size of the preceding vehicle on a driver's retina is considered as the stimuli and determines the driving behaviors. NGSIM trajectory data are applied to calibrate and validate the VIM under two scenarios, i.e. following the car and following the truck, whose fitting performance outperforms that of visual angle car following model (VAM). Through linear stability analyses for VIM, it can be drawn that the asymmetry in traffic flow is preserved; the larger vehicle width, vehicle length and vehicle apparent size all benefit enlarging the traffic flow stable region; the traffic flow unstable region when following the car tends to fall in the relatively small distance headway range compared with that when following the truck. After that, numerical experiments demonstrate that the visual imaging information applied in VIM is more contributive to the traffic flow stability than the visual angle information in VAM when following the truck in the relatively large distance headway or involving the driver's perception threshold, i.e. Weber ratio; introducing Weber ratio would break the originally stable traffic flow or deteriorate the traffic fluctuation, which however can be alleviated by increasing drivers' sensitivity, e.g., decreasing Weber ratio. Finally, VIM is verified to be able to satisfy the consistency criteria well from the theoretical aspect.},

abstract = {For decades researchers have been pointing out significant differences in the driving behavior between young and old and between male and female drivers. There are many studies concerning age and gender differences in risk perception, traffic accident involvement, traffic violations, alcohol consumption, and risky driving. However, little effort has been focused on studying the behavioral differences in overtaking maneuvers on two-lane highways. A considerable percentage of the fatal accidents on two-lane highways is directly related to overtaking maneuvers. Therefore, the main focus of this study is to understand better the overtaking behavior of different drivers classified by their age and gender. Data on the overtaking behavior of 100 drivers were collected with an interactive driving simulator. Several scenarios of two-lane rural highways with different geometric and traffic conditions were developed. The results show interesting and significant differences in the overtaking behavior of drivers depending on their age and gender. These differences are mainly in the frequency of overtaking maneuvers, overtaking time duration, following distances, critical overtaking gaps, and desired driving speeds. Geometric and traffic conditions were also found to have a significant impact on drivers' overtaking behavior. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the overtaking behavior of different groups of drivers and thus have implications for road safety intervention programs and the development of effective risk reduction strategies adapted and targeted for different age and gender groups.},

The models with calibrated parameters are validated not only under uncongested traffic conditions but also under congested traffic conditions. Unlike the results in previous study based on experimental data, there are obvious differences in the performance of these models. Models with more parameters produce relatively lower error rate in calibration process but over-fitting problem appears in validation process. The model very popular in the physical community is found not suitable for real traffic simulation, although it can represent some traffic phenomena under certain condition. Even with simple rules and discrete variables, cellular automata model achieves satisfactory simulation results both in calibration and validation process. Besides, it is also noteworthy that all of the models perform rather worse in validation process than in calibration process. Using different parameters or even different models under different traffic conditions seems to be feasible for depicting real traffic more accurately.},

The importance of properly calibrating these traffic simulations is evidenced by the adoption of microsimulation calibration standards by several state and federal transportation authorities. A component of the calibration process is the calibration of the simulation for capacity. Capacity is a high-level measurement that is a function of many lower level user-defined input parameters. VISSIM utilizes psychophysical car-following models that rely on ten user-defined parameters to represent freeway driving behavior. Several VISSIM driver behavior parameters have been shown to have a significant impact on roadway capacity. This paper seeks further understanding of the performance of the VISSIM traffic microsimulator by investigating the impact of driver behavior parameter combinations on a measure of freeway capacity.

Considering heteroscedasticity in the effects of explanatory variables on injury severity, the heteroscedastic ordered logit (HOL) models were developed for single- and two-vehicle crashes separately. The results of the models show that there exists heteroscedasticity for young drivers (???30), safety equipment and ejection in the single-vehicle crash model, and female drivers, safety equipment and head-on collision in the two-vehicle crash models. The results also show that young car drivers have opposite effects between single-car and car-car crashes, and sideswipe crashes have opposite effects between car-car and truck-truck crashes. The study demonstrates that separate HOL models for single-vehicle and different types of two-vehicle crashes can identify differential effects of factors on driver's injury severity. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rear-end collisions account for almost 30{\%} of automotive crashes. Rear-end collision avoidance systems (RECASs) may offer a promising approach to help drivers avoid these crashes. Two experiments performed using a high-fidelity motion-based driving simulator examined driver responses to evaluate the efficacy of a RECAS. The first experiment showed that early warnings helped distracted drivers react more quickly--and thereby avoid more collisions--than did late warnings or no warnings. Compared with the no-warning condition, an early RECAS warning reduced the number of collisions by 80.7{\%}. Assuming collision severity is proportional to kinetic energy, the early warning reduced collision severity by 96.5{\%}. In contrast, the late warning reduced collisions by 50.0{\%} and the corresponding severity by 87.5{\%}. The second experiment showed that RECAS benefits even undistracted drivers. Analysis of the braking process showed that warnings provide a potential safety benefit by reducing the time required for drivers to release the accelerator. Warnings do not, however, speed application of the brake, increase maximum deceleration, or affect mean deceleration. These results provide the basis for a computational model of driver performance that was used to extrapolate the findings and identify the most promising parameter settings. Potential applications of these results include methods for evaluating collision warning systems, algorithm design guidance, and driver performance model input.},

abstract = {Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a distance measure that compares two time series after optimally aligning them. DTW is being used for decades in thousands of academic and industrial projects despite the very expensive computational complexity, O(n2). These applications include data mining, image processing, signal processing, robotics and computer graphics among many others. In spite of all this research effort, there are many myths and misunderstanding about DTW in the literature, for example "it is too slow to be useful" or "the warping window size does not matter much." In this tutorial, we correct these misunderstandings and we summarize the research efforts in optimizing both the efficiency and effectiveness of both the basic DTW algorithm, and of the higher-level algorithms that exploit DTW such as similarity search, clustering and classification. We will discuss variants of DTW such as constrained DTW, multidimensional DTW and asynchronous DTW, and optimization techniques such as lower bounding, early abandoning, run-length encoding, bounded approximation and hardware optimization. We will discuss a multitude of application areas including physiological monitoring, social media mining, activity recognition and animal sound processing. The optimization techniques are generalizable to other domains on various data types and problems.},

abstract = {Connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) technologies are about to be in the market in the near future. This requires transportation facilities ready to operate in a mixed traffic environment where a portion of vehicles are CAVs and the remaining are manual vehicles. Since CAVs are able to run with less spacing and headway compared with manual vehicles or mixed traffic, allocating a number of freeway lanes exclusive to CAVs may improve the overall performance of freeways. In this paper, we propose an analytical managed lane model to evaluate the freeway flow in mixed traffic and to determine the optimal number of lanes to be allocated to CAVs. The proposed model is investigated in two different operation environments: single-lane and managed lane environments. We further define three different CAV technology scenarios: neutral, conservative, and aggressive. In the single-lane problem, the influence of CAV penetration rates on mixed traffic capacity is examined in each scenario. In the managed lanes problem, we propose a method to determine the optimal number of dedicated lanes for CAVs under different settings. A number of numerical examples with different geometries and demand levels are investigated for all three scenarios. A sensitivity analysis on the penetration rates is conducted. The results show that more aggressive CAV technologies need less specific allocated lanes because they can follow the vehicles with less time and space headways.},

We extend the HDM by adding variable, situation-dependent reaction times, different types of driver distraction, and driving errors to the model.

It is suitable for a more realistic simulation of human longitudinal guidance behaviour in the lower velocity range, like in urban traffic. The algorithm was identified and developed by means of a driving simulator study, which is introduced as well. While the decision making process in recent car following models based on Wiedemann is solely determined by the time headway to the leading vehicle, the results of the study show that information about time to collision is also used in the lower velocity range. This approach delivers a more realistic simulation of human car following behaviour, which can be integrated into driver models for microscopic traffic simulations and for the control of surrounding traffic in driving simulators.},

@article{Pariota2016,
abstract = {Many application fields in transportation engineering can benefit from an accurate modelling of car-following behavior. In particular, in recent years, an increased importance is assigned to embed behavioral abilities in ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) and in driving automation solutions. However, accurate development of car-following models needs for accounting of the drivers' heterogeneity, which can be easily observed in car-following data. This paper contributes to analyze different sources of heterogeneity with particular focus on three factors: the dispersion over-time of the behavior of a single driver; the heterogeneous behaviors of different drivers; and the possible bias introduced by some oversimplification of the modelling framework, with particular reference to the type of leading vehicle. Our analyses are based on the observation of car-following trajectories collected in a large experiment involving one hundred drivers. Observed behaviors have been interpreted by means of several car-following models proposed in past. The comparison of the values of the parameters identified for the models (versus observed data) is adopted for the analyses. Moreover, directly observed variables (car-following speed and spacing) are adopted to complement and confirm the analyses. Results show that the greater among the sources of dispersion is the across-driver heterogeneity and that by taking into account such an inherent drivers' dispersion of car-following behaviors it is possible to better identify also the effect of the modelling oversimplifications induced by not considering the type of leading vehicle.},

abstract = {A surrogate measure called the aggregated crash propensity metric (ACPM) is proposed for simulation-based conflict studies to allow for relative comparisons and safety evaluations among intersection designs. A probabilistic crash propensity model is developed to determine the crash probability of simulated conflicts by introducing the distributions of reaction time and maximum braking rates. This model is able to generate the ACPM for three different crash types: crossing, rear end, and lane change. An experimental validation effort was conducted by simulating 12 intersections through the simulation package VISSIM. The surrogate safety assessment model is used to extract useful conflict data for entry into the model to estimate the ACPM. The Spearman rank tests indicate that the ACPM is able to identify the relative safety among traffic facilities and treatments. Notably, the ACPM outperforms the Highway Safely Manual procedures in rank tests. Preliminary efforts to correlate the ACPM with crashes and to use it as a crash predictor indicate that regression models are well fitted for the ACPM and predicted real crash frequency; this finding suggests that its potential is directly linked to real crashes.},

abstract = {Problem: Braking time (BT) is a critical component in safe driving, and various approaches have been applied to minimize it. This study analyzed the components of BT in order to assess the effects of age, gender, vehicle transmission type, and event uncertainty, on its two primary components, perception-reaction time and brake-movement time. Method: Perception-reaction time and brake-movement time were measured at the onset of lights for 72 subjects in a simulator. The six experimental conditions were three levels of uncertainty conditions (none, some, and some+false alarms) and two types of transmission (manual and automatic). The 72 subjects, half male and half female, were further divided into three age groups (mean of 23, 30, and 62 years). Each subject had 10 trials in each of the three levels of uncertainty conditions. Results: Transmission type did not significantly affect either perception-reaction time or brake-movement time. Perception-reaction time increased significantly from 0.32 to 0.42 s (P{\textless}.05) as uncertainty increased but brake-movement time did not change. Perception-reaction time increased (from 0.35 to 0.43 s) with age but brake-movement time did not change with age. Gender did not affect perception-reaction time but did affect brake-movement time (males 0.19 s vs. females 0.16 s). Impact on Industry: At 90 km/h, a car travels 0.25 m in 0.01 s. Consequently, even such small effects multiplied by millions of vehicle-kilometers can contribute to significant savings in lives and damages.},

There is, however, debate that this approach results only in ‘self-selection', that is that only residents willing to travel by public transport will locate in these places with resultant minimal impact on car -user households. If policy solutions towards public transport are to be effective, it is necessary to understand the multi-dimensional relationship between location behavior and travel patterns of residents living in proximity to public transport.

abstract = {Analysis and recognition of driving styles are profoundly important to intelligent transportation and vehicle calibration. This paper presents a novel driving style analysis framework using the primitive driving patterns learned from naturalistic driving data. In order to achieve this, first, a Bayesian nonparametric learning method based on a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is introduced to extract primitive driving patterns from time series driving data without prior knowledge of the number of these patterns. In the Bayesian nonparametric approach, we utilize a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) instead of learning the unknown number of smooth dynamical modes of HSMM, thus generating the primitive driving patterns. Each primitive pattern is clustered and then labeled using behavioral semantics according to drivers' physical and psychological perception thresholds. For each driver, 75 primitive driving patterns in car-following scenarios are learned and semantically labeled. In order to show the HDP-HSMM's utility to learn primitive driving patterns, other two Bayesian nonparametric approaches, HDP-HMM and sticky HDP-HMM, are compared. The naturalistic driving data of 18 drivers were collected from the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPDM) database. The individual driving styles are discussed according to distribution characteristics of the learned primitive driving patterns and also the difference in driving styles among drivers are evaluated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed primitive pattern-based method can allow one to semantically understand driver behaviors and driving styles.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper was to build upon previous research, identify the variables that significantly influence driver response times, and to determine the amplitude (constant) of that influence. The goal is that this research will explain why seemingly analogous published studies have come to very different driver response time results. An analogous driver response situation is defined as being in one of four groups: (1) lead vehicles that were stopped or moving slowly, (2) being cut off (when a vehicle changes lanes into the path of the responding driver), (3) path intrusions, or (4) known lights, icons or sounds. It was found that research that measured response times in analogous situations can be used to estimate the mean response time for a particular situation if adjustments are made to account for methodological differences between the studies. Non-analogous studies are poor predictors of driver response. (An anticipated light stimulus response cannot accurately predict the response time to a path intrusion or lead vehicle). Mean driver response times can be predicted within 400 ms without accounting for individual difference. Therefore, external validity can be obtained regardless of the testing method (closed course, simulator or road), as long as the subject is unaware of either the stimulus or the appropriate response. Having a subject respond to multiple events does not (by itself) suggest that drivers will respond significantly faster.},

@article{El-Tantawy2009,
abstract = {The demand for goods and services in North America has increased dramatically over the past few decades. This demand increase resulted in an associated increase in truck traffic on North American highways, escalating congestion, operation, and safety concerns. This in turn has led to increasing interest in strategies to reduce interaction between trucks and cars, including truck restrictions and dedicated truck lanes. The purpose of this paper is to implement algorithms for evaluating safety measures for different scenarios of truck lane restrictions and dedicated truck lanes using microscopic traffic simulation. The measures of performance calculated in this study are lane changing, merging, and rear-end conflicts. These measures are analyzed for truck-restricted lanes and dedicated truck lanes on the Gardiner Expressway in downtown Toronto, Canada. Simulation scenarios are developed by varying lane strategies and truck percentage. Simulation results showed that implementation of a single truck-restricted lane makes little difference to most conflict measures. Restricting trucks from the leftmost two lanes results in more substantial reductions in lane changing conflicts, but causes some increased freeway merging conflicts involving trucks. Dedicating the leftmost lane only to trucks also reduces lane changing conflicts but increases lane merging conflicts. Because lane changing conflicts are far more frequent than merging conflicts, there appears to be a net safety benefit by either restricting trucks from the left two lanes or dedicating the left lane to trucks. Relationships between lane strategy and rear-end conflicts are weak. Truck lane strategies are most effective when truck percentage exceeds 15{\%}.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This paper explores the development of a rigorous computational model of driver behavior in a cognitive architecture--a computational framework with underlying psychological theories that incorporate basic properties and limitations of the human system. BACKGROUND: Computational modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the complex task of driving, allowing researchers to simulate driver behavior and explore the parameters and constraints of this behavior. METHOD: An integrated driver model developed in the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) cognitive architecture is described that focuses on the component processes of control, monitoring, and decision making in a multilane highway environment. RESULTS: This model accounts for the steering profiles, lateral position profiles, and gaze distributions of human drivers during lane keeping, curve negotiation, and lane changing. CONCLUSION: The model demonstrates how cognitive architectures facilitate understanding of driver behavior in the context of general human abilities and constraints and how the driving domain benefits cognitive architectures by pushing model development toward more complex, realistic tasks. APPLICATION: The model can also serve as a core computational engine for practical applications that predict and recognize driver behavior and distraction.},

abstract = {The maneuvering models of motorcycles in previous studies often considered motorcycles' traveling in terms of movements in a physical static lane and not in terms of dynamic virtual lane-based movements. For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88{\%} of the observed maneuvers – either staying in the current lane or turning left or right – could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.},

Motor and movement primitives and modules might exist at the neural, dynamic and kinematic levels with complicated mapping among the elementary building blocks subserving these different levels of representation.

abstract = {Tasks such as steering, braking, and intercepting moving objects constitute a class of behaviors, known as visually guided actions, which are typically carried out under continuous control on the basis of visual information. Several decades of research on visually guided action have resulted in an inventory of control laws that describe for each task how information about the sufficiency of one's current state is used to make ongoing adjustments. Although a considerable amount of important research has been generated within this framework, several aspects of these tasks that are essential for successful performance cannot be captured. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing framework, discuss its limitations, and introduce a new framework that emphasizes the necessity of calibration and perceptual learning. Within the proposed framework, successful human performance on these tasks is a matter of learning to detect and calibrate optical information about the boundaries that separate possible from impossible actions. This resolves a long-lasting incompatibility between theories of visually guided action and the concept of an affordance. The implications of adopting this framework for the design of experiments and models of visually guided action are discussed.},

abstract = {Rear-end crashes account for more than one in five fatal crashes in the U.S. The rear-end crash scenario most commonly associated with fatal crashes involves a following vehicle traveling 40 to 70 mph closing on a lead vehicle at a rate greater than 30 mph. The current research compiled an analysis of the literature to identify the kinematic factors, environmental factors, traffic-related factors and individual differences that are likely to influence drivers' responses when closing on a slower-moving or stopped lead vehicle [LV]. In Part 1, several primarily kinematic-based methods for modeling drivers' responses to a LV were compared for high-speed closing events. Methods utilizing looming (angular growth rate) equations were shown to predict drivers' responses and time-to-contact methods (Inverse Tau) were conditionally accurate when applied to specific crash scenarios. However, the ratio or nominal response time methods did not predict drivers' responses in most crash scenarios. Overall, with few exceptions, drivers responded in ways that could best be described when using the looming equation. In Part 2, the influence of the environment, traffic in the area, and individual differences were evaluated. Drivers responded much earlier than the looming equation suggested when in congested traffic, when following closely behind the lead vehicle, when the LV was parked on the shoulder, and when the lead vehicle was sideways across the road. In reduced lighting conditions, drivers responded significantly later when the lead vehicle had narrowed taillights, when the distances between the taillights was narrowed from the normal width, and when the lights on the lead vehicle were dimmer than normal. Interchanges, work zones, and inclines (or elevated roadways) were identified as locations where rear-end crash rate increased significantly. Drivers commonly responded 0.2 to 0.35 second faster when the lead vehicle displayed emergency flashing lights. Lastly, many drivers, whether a crash occurred or not, were found to make mirror glances in the moments before reaching the looming threshold. Hence, unbeknownst to a following driver, he/she may be looking away from the forward roadway at a critical moment while closing at a dangerous speed.},

@phdthesis{Ahmed1999,
abstract = {This thesis contributes to the development of microscopic traffic performance models which includes the acceleration and lane changing models. It enhancees the existing models and develops new ones. Another major contribution of this thesis is the empirical work, i.e., estimating the models using statistically rigorous methods and microscopic data collected from real traffic. The acceleration model defines two regimes of traffic flow: the car-following regime and the free-flow regime. In the car-following regime, a driver is assumed to follow his/her leader, while in the free-flow regime, a driver is assumed to try to attain his/her desired speed. A probabilistic model, that is based on a time headway threshold, is used to determine the regime the driver belongs to. Heterogeneity across drivers is captured through the headway threshold and reaction time distributions. The parameters of the car-following and free-flow acceleration models along with the headway threshold and reaction time distributions are jointly estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method. The lane changing decision process is modeled as a sequence of three steps: decision to consider a lange change, choice of a target lane, ans gap acceptance. Since acceptable gaps are hard to find in a heavily congested traffic, a forced mergin model that captures forces lane changing behavior and courtesy yielding is developed. A discrete choice model framework is used to model the impact of the surrounding traffic environment and lane configuration on drivers' lane changing decision process. The models are estimated using actual traffic data collected from Interstate 93 at the Central Artery, located in downtown Boston, MA, USA. In addition to assessing the model parameters from statistical and behavioral standpoints, the models are validated using a microscopic traffic simulator. Overall, the empirical results are encouraging, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the modeling framework.},

abstract = {A conceptual and computational framework is proposed for modelling of human sensorimotor control, and is exemplified for the sensorimotor task of steering a car. The framework emphasises control intermittency, and extends on existing models by suggesting that the nervous system implements intermittent control using a combination of (1) motor primitives, (2) prediction of sensory outcomes of motor actions, and (3) evidence accumulation of prediction errors. It is shown that approximate but useful sensory predictions in the intermittent control context can be constructed without detailed forward models, as a superposition of simple prediction primitives, resembling neurobiologically observed corollary discharges. The proposed mathematical framework allows straightforward extension to intermittent behaviour from existing one-dimensional continuous models in the linear control and ecological psychology traditions. Empirical observations from a driving simulator provide support for some of the framework assumptions: It is shown that human steering control, in routine lane-keeping and in a demanding near-limit task, is better described as a sequence of discrete stepwise steering adjustments, than as continuous control. Furthermore, the amplitudes of individual steering adjustments are well predicted by a compound visual cue signalling steering error, and even better so if also adjusting for predictions of how the same cue is affected by previous control. Finally, evidence accumulation is shown to explain observed covariability between inter-adjustment durations and adjustment amplitudes, seemingly better so than the type of threshold mechanisms that are typically assumed in existing models of intermittent control.},

In the first experiment, the same subjects were tested on two driving tasks using a PC-based driving simulator and the psychomotor vigilance test. The diffusion model fit the response time distributions for each task and individual subject well. Model parameters were found to correlate across tasks, which suggests that common component processes were being tapped in the three tasks. The model was also fit to a distracted driving experiment of Cooper and Strayer (Human Factors, 50, 893-902, 2008). Results showed that distraction altered performance by affecting the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate) and/or increasing the boundary settings. This provides an interpretation of cognitive distraction whereby conversing on a cell phone diverts attention from the normal accumulation of information in the driving environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Wirelessly connected vehicles that exchange information about traffic conditions can reduce delays caused by congestion. At a 2-to-1 lane reduction, the improvement in flow past a bottleneck due to traffic with a random mixture of 40{\%} connected vehicles is found to be 52{\%}. Control is based on connected-vehicle-reported velocities near the bottleneck. In response to indications of congestion the connected vehicles, which are also adaptive cruise control vehicles, reduce their speed in slowdown regions. Early lane changes of manually driven vehicles from the terminated lane to the continuous lane are induced by the slowing connected vehicles. Self-organized congestion at the bottleneck is thus delayed or eliminated, depending upon the incoming flow magnitude. For the large majority of vehicles, travel times past the bottleneck are substantially reduced. Control is responsible for delaying the onset of congestion as the incoming flow increases. Adaptive cruise control increases the flow out of the congested state at the bottleneck. The nature of the congested state, when it occurs, appears to be similar under a variety of conditions. Typically 80-100 vehicles are approximately equally distributed between the lanes in the 500 m region prior to the end of the terminated lane. Without the adaptive cruise control capability, connected vehicles can delay the onset of congestion but do not increase the asymptotic flow past the bottleneck. Calculations are done using the Kerner-Klenov three-phase theory, stochastic discrete-time model for manual vehicles. The dynamics of the connected vehicles is given by a conventional adaptive cruise control algorithm plus commanded deceleration. Because time in the model for manual vehicles is discrete (one-second intervals), it is assumed that the acceleration of any vehicle immediately in front of a connected vehicle is constant during the time interval, thereby preserving the computational simplicity and speed of a discrete-time model.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the characteristics of transportation energy consumption and urban form elements that were actively argued along with Environmentally Sound and Sustainable Development (ESSD). This paper can be divided into two parts: an examination of the theories and a practical analysis of domestic, small-, and medium-sized cities. Firstly, in the examination of theories, we surveyed the arguments about the sustainable urban form. Secondly, we made some hypotheses about the relationships between transportation energy consumption, city size, density, and center distribution pattern. Thirdly, we tested those hypotheses and examined the suitability of policies for each alternative for small- and medium-sized cities in Korea. The main themes in this paper are as follows. Firstly, how does the city size, density, etc. affect the transportation energy consumption? Secondly, in an overcrowded Korean situation, which alternative is the more suitable sustainable urban form from the point of transportation energy consumption, i.e., concentration or decentralized concentration? Thirdly, we examined the argument that a densely centralized development can reduce the need for travel, increase the transit use, and decrease automobile use. From the results of the analysis, we found that as the population increases, transportation energy represented by yearly gasoline consumption per automobile and the average yearly energy consumption as a result of surface transportation per 1,000 persons tends to decrease. Further, if the degree of city's concentration represented by Gini coefficient is high, energy efficiency tends to decrease. Besides, the influential factors on the transportation energy consumption among the indicators of urban form could be road ratio and density. Whereas the road ratio is not related to the transportation energy consumption, road density is. From the analyzed results, we can deduce planning implications concerned with Korean cities. Firstly, Korean cities are already highly centralized so a decentralization policy should be carried out to increase transportation energy efficiency. In any case, in the case of high-density cities, multinuclei cities are better than mononuclear ones. Further, to increase the transportation energy efficiency, policies for high road densities through the construction of new roads in spite of narrow road widths are more effective than those for high road ratio-widening existing roads.},

abstract = {Driver perception uncertainty characterized in perceived relatnd reaction time plays a key role in influencing car-following behavior; and however, is rarely investigated in related literature. Grounded on quantum optical flow theory, we propose a dynamic and stochastic driver perception model to investigate the relationship between the uncertainty of perceived relative speed and that of reaction time during car following. Specifically, the proposed model hypothesizes that driver perceived speed and reaction time are time-varying and uncertain, and correlate in a trade-off relationship mimicking the form of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. To test the assertion that a trade-off relationship of uncertainty in perceived relative speed and reaction time exists in car following, this study conducts qualitative analysis followed by a two-stage experiment rooted in quantum optical flow theory using data collected from a driver simulator. Analytical results further elucidate car-following phenomena under driver-perception uncertainty, potentially facilitating the development of new traffic flow theories.},

abstract = {According the driver perception hypothesis, horizontal curves appear sharper or flatter when overlapping with crest or sag vertical curves, respectively. Confirmations of this hypothesis are provided by studies carried out using non-interactive techniques that do not allow the analysis of the driver's reactions to the visual perception of the road. This study was aimed to add to the body of knowledge concerning driver's speed behavior on combined curves, as well as to test the perception hypothesis based on the speed data collected during tests in the interactive CRISS driving simulator. Speeds on the tangent-curve transition of crest and sag combinations were compared to those on the tangent-curve transition of horizontal curves with the same radii but on a flat grade (reference curves). For the crest combinations the results of the statistical analyses were fully consistent with the perception hypothesis. On the sag combinations, on the contrary, the driver's speed behavior did not differ in any statistically significant way from that on the reference curves. Therefore this finding did not support the perception hypothesis on the sag combinations. The effects of the combined curves on the driver's speed behavior did not change in function of the level of the radius. Some implications of these findings have been highlighted.},

Asymmetric transfer between the 2 ranges of speeds showed that those trained with slow speeds were very successful when tested with a faster range of speeds. Those trained with fast speeds did not do as well when tested on slower speeds.

abstract = {Prediction of driver reaction to the lead vehicle motion based on the perception-reaction time (PRT) is critical for prediction of rear-end crash risk. This study determines PRT at various spacings in approaching and braking conditions, and examines the association of PRT and deceleration rate with crash risk. For these tasks, a total of 50 drivers' behavior was observed in a driving simulator experiment with 4 different scenarios – reaction to a decelerating lead vehicle, reaction to a stopped lead vehicle, perception of a lead vehicle's speed change, and perception of a slow-moving lead vehicle. The study tested three hypotheses of PRT including perception and reaction thresholds and the evidence accumulation framework using a visual variable (tau-inverse). It was found that the drivers neither reacted after a specific PRT from the start of perception nor reacted at a specific value of tau-inverse. Rather, the drivers generally reacted when the accumulation of evidence (tau-inverse) over time reached a threshold. It was also found that the magnitude of deceleration rate depends on the tau-inverse at the start of braking and hence, higher crash risk was associated with higher level of urgency and insufficient brake force rather than longer PRT. This study demonstrates that the evidence accumulation framework is a promising method of predicting driver reaction in approaching and braking conditions for different types of lead vehicle, and the level of urgency is important for predicting the probability of crash.},

abstract = {Driving behavior can be influenced by many factors that are not feasible to collect in driving behavior studies. The research presented in this paper investigates the characteristics of a wide range of driving behaviors linking driving states to the drivers' actions. The proposed methodology is structured such that a known state can be linked to multiple actions, thus accounting for the effects of unknown driving state factors. A two-step algorithm was developed and used for the segmentation and clustering of driving behaviors. The algorithm segments and clusters car-following behaviors based on eight state-action variables: the longitudinal acceleration, the lateral acceleration, the yaw rate, the vehicle speed, the lane offset, the yaw angle, the range, and the range rate. The results of this methodology are state-action clusters that define the driving pattern of drivers. The sample used in this paper included 20 different drivers, i.e., ten car and ten truck drivers. The results revealed that behavior patterns were different between car drivers but not between truck drivers. The results also show that car drivers exhibit behaviors that are unique to each driver, whereas truck drivers show a common driving pattern. The characteristics and frequency of recognized driving patterns are provided in this paper, along with the corresponding modeling parameters of each pattern.},

I thank the commentators for their thoughtful remarks pointing to directions in which the theory needs to evolve. Two questions need to be addressed. First, how is multiple perceptual information about an action-gap composed into a single 'message'? David Regan's and Rob Gray's experiments on the synergistic use of binocular and monocular $\tau$ information, and Barrie Frost's suggestion of two sets of 'tau operator neurons' concerned with $\tau$ information from surfaces and from objects are pertinent here. Second, how are the closings of multiple temporally overlapping action-gaps prospectively organized to realize a coherent action, with $\tau$ information about their 'current futures', to use Reinoud Bootsma's neat term? Careful experiments are needed to determine what is actually going on in shifting gaze and in numerous other cases of synergistic $\tau$ control, from playing the piano to sprinting down a track.

abstract = {Using disaggregated data from the Danish National Travel Survey conducted between 2006–2011, this study compares the travel patterns of older (65–84 years of age) and younger (18–64 years of age) adults regarding land use, socio-economic conditions and urban structures. The results highlight significant differences between travel patterns and their urban form correlates for the older and younger adult populations. Spatial variables such as density and regional accessibility have different and potentially reverse associations with travel among older adults. The car use of older adults is not substituted by other modes in high-density settings, as is the case for younger adults. Older adults do not respond to high regional accessibility by reducing distance traveled, but travel longer and are also more likely to continue using a car in high-access conditions. Spatial structural conditions have the potential to reinforce the need to use private cars among older adults as they attempt to maintain their independent travel and mobility. Older persons are a growing demographic group and thus, the implications of this paper for planning and policies targeting modal shift are significant. How population aging may contribute to car travel saturation or to peak travel requires further investigation.},

abstract = {When steering down a winding road, drivers have been shown to use both near and far regions of the road for guidance during steering. We propose a model of steering that explicitly embodies this idea, using both a 'near point' to maintain a central lane position and a 'far point' to account for the upcoming roadway. Unlike control models that integrate near and far information to compute curvature or more complex features, our model relies solely on one perceptually plausible feature of the near and far points, namely the visual direction to each point. The resulting parsimonious model can be run in simulation within a realistic highway environment to facilitate direct comparison between model and human behavior. Using such simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed two-point model is able to account for four interesting aspects of steering behavior: curve negotiation with occluded visual regions, corrective steering after a lateral drift, lane changing, and individual differences.},

abstract = {Multitasking, such as the concurrent use of a mobile phone and operating a motor vehicle, is a significant distraction that impairs driving performance and is becoming a leading cause of motor vehicle crashes. This study investigates the impact of mobile phone conversations on car-following behaviour. The CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator was used to test a group of young Australian drivers aged 18-26 years on a car-following task in three randomised phone conditions: baseline (no phone conversation), hands-free and handheld. Repeated measure ANOVA was applied to examine the effect of mobile phone distraction on selected car-following variables such as driving speed, spacing, and time headway. Overall, drivers tended to select slower driving speeds, larger vehicle spacings, and longer time headways when they were engaged in either hands-free or handheld phone conversations, suggesting possible risk compensatory behaviour. In addition, phone conversations while driving influenced car-following behaviour such that variability was increased in driving speeds, vehicle spacings, and acceleration and decelerations. To further investigate car-following behaviour of distracted drivers, driver time headways were modelled using Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE). After controlling for various exogenous factors, the model predicts an increase of 0.33s in time headway when a driver is engaged in hands-free phone conversation and a 0.75s increase for handheld phone conversation. The findings will improve the collective understanding of distraction on driving performance, in particular car following behaviour which is most critical in the determination of rear-end crashes.},

Logan and Thomas J. Palmeri (Psychological Review, 2010Oct, Vol 1174, 1113-1143). The presentation of the colors in Figure 3, Panel A was incorrect due to an error in the production process. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2010-18180-001.) Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 118(1) of Psychological Review (see record 2010-23057-001). Two grant numbers were incorrectly cited in the author note, and one correct grant number was omitted. The author note incorrectly indicated that research was supported by grants RO1-MH55806 and RO1-EY13358. In addition, grant R01-EY08890 should have been listed. Stochastic accumulator models account for response time in perceptual decision-making tasks by assuming that perceptual evidence accumulates to a threshold. The present investigation mapped the firing rate of frontal eye field (FEF) visual neurons onto perceptual evidence and the firing rate of FEF movement neurons onto evidence accumulation to test alternative models of how evidence is combined in the accumulation process. The models were evaluated on their ability to predict both response time distributions and movement neuron activity observed in monkeys performing a visual search task. Models that assume gating of perceptual evidence to the accumulating units provide the best account of both behavioral and neural data. These results identify discrete stages of processing with anatomically distinct neural populations and rule out several alternative architectures. The results also illustrate the use of neurophysiological data as a model selection tool and establish a novel framework to bridge computational and neural levels of explanation.

abstract = {We present data from several German freeways showing different kinds of congested traffic forming near road inhomogeneities, specifically lane closings, intersections, or uphill gradients. The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traffic upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traffic. The experimental findings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traffic near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\{}$\backslash$bf 82{\}}, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a novel continuous microscopic single-lane model, the ``intelligent driver model'' (IDM), using the empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has practically the same effect as an on-ramp.},

Over a 6-day-period traffic flow measures were taken in a four-way junction with stop signs on the minor road. It was found that for vehicles in a car following situation headway and TTC are independent of each other. The percentage of small headways is relatively constant across different locations in the junction, while the percentage of small TTC values varies between different locations. It is recommended to use headway for enforcement purposes, because small headways generate potentially dangerous situations. TTC, on the other hand, should be used when a certain traffic environment is to be evaluated in terms of safety, because it indicates the actual occurrences of dangerous situations.},

abstract = {Accurately estimating driving styles is crucial to designing useful driver assistance systems and vehicle control systems for autonomous driving that match how people drive. This paper presents a novel way to identify driving style not in terms of the durations or frequencies of individual maneuver states, but rather the transition patterns between them to see how they are interrelated. Driving behavior in highway traffic was categorized into 12 maneuver states, based on which 144 (12 × 12) maneuver transition probabilities were obtained. A conditional likelihood maximization method was employed to extract typical maneuver transition patterns that could represent driving style strategies, from the 144 probabilities. Random forest algorithm was adopted to classify driving styles using the selected features. Results showed that transitions concerning five maneuver states – free driving, approaching, near following, constrained left and right lane changes – could be used to classify driving style reliably. Comparisons with traditional methods were presented and discussed in detail to show that transition probabilities between maneuvers were better at predicting driving style than traditional maneuver frequencies in behavioral analysis.},

abstract = {A general model (minimizing overall braking induced by lane change, MOBIL) is proposed to derive lane-changing rules for discretionary and mandatory lane changes for a wide class of car-following models. Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane changes are determined in terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated with micro- scopic traffic models. This determination allows for the formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria for both symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of these car-following models are automatically transferred to the lane-changing rules. Although the safety criterion prevents critical lane changes and collisions, the incentive crite- rion takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of other drivers associated with a lane change via the “politeness factor.” The parameter allows one to vary the motivation for lane changing from purely egois- tic to more cooperative driving behavior. This novel feature allows one first to prevent lane changes for a marginal advantage if they obstruct other drivers and second to let an aggressive driver induce the lane change of a slower driver ahead in order to no longer be obstructed. This phe- nomenon is common for asymmetric passing rules with a dedicated lane for passing. The model is applied to traffic simulations of cars and trucks with the intelligent driver model as the underlying car-following model. An open system with an on-ramp is studied, and the resulting lane- changing rate is investigated as a function of the spatial coordinate as well as a function of traffic density. In},

Such safety indicators can be applied in the comparison of a do-nothing case with an adapted situation, e.g. the introduction of intelligent driver support systems. In contrast to the classical time-to-collision value, measured at a cross section, the improved safety indicators use vehicle trajectories collected over a specific time horizon for a certain roadway segment to calculate the overall safety indicator value. Vehicle-specific indicator values as well as safety-critical probabilities can easily be determined from the developed safety measures. Application of the derived safety indicators is demonstrated for the assessment of the potential safety impacts of driver support systems from which it appears that some Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Control (AICC) designs are more safety-critical than the reference case without these systems. It is suggested that the indicator threshold value to be applied in the safety assessment has to be adapted when advanced AICC-systems with safe characteristics are introduced.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {Driving is a multitasking activity that requires drivers to manage their attention among various driving- and non-driving-related tasks. When one models drivers as continuous controllers, the discrete nature of drivers' control actions is lost and with it an important component for characterizing behavioral variability. A proposal is made for the use of cognitive architectures for developing models of driver behavior that integrate cognitive and perceptual-motor processes in a serial model of task and attention management. A cognitive architecture is a computational framework that incorporates built-in, well-tested parameters and constraints on cognitive and perceptual-motor processes. All driver models implemented in a cognitive architecture necessarily inherit these parameters and constraints, resulting in more predictive and psychologically plausible models than those that do not characterize driving as a multitasking activity. These benefits are demonstrated with a driver model developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The model is validated by comparing its behavior to that of human drivers navigating a four-lane highway with traffic in a fixed-based driving simulator. Results show that the model successfully predicts aspects of both lower-level control, such as steering and eye movements during lane changes, and higher-level cognitive tasks, such as task management and decision making. Many of these predictions are not explicitly built into the model but come from the cognitive architecture as a result of the model's implementation in the ACT-R architecture.},

@article{Hoffmann1996,
abstract = {Data are presented on the ability of drivers to perceive and scale the relative velocity between their own and a lead vehicle. Experiments were carried out on four groups of subjects using Ekman's ratio-rating method. Only when the subtended angular velocity of the lead vehicle exceeded about 0.003 rad/s were the subjects able to scale the relative velocity. The threshold subtended angular velocity obtained in the experiments was very much affected by the ability of subjects to use the concept of a ratio-engineering students found this a simpler task than did subjects from the general population. The result of this was that the values used by engineering students were closer to the real values. The relative velocity was perceived non-linearly, with a Stevens' power law exponent of about 0.8. It was found that linear models gave as good a fit to the data. The implications of the results of the experiments are (i) traffic flow models that include human visual characteristics must consider the "dead zones" in response produced by thresholds of subtended angle change subtended angular velocity; (ii) it may be necessary to consider the non-linear relationship between perceived relative velocity and actual relative velocity; (iii) in overtaking, the driver will not be able to scale the speed of the oncoming vehicle as the subtended angular velocity will be below the threshold value at the time of making the decision to overtake.},

A recurring question for policy-makers, transport planners and urban designers is therefore which factors influence vehicle ownership. In this paper we present a vehicle ownership for the case of Singapore. Models are estimated using the Household Interview Travel Survey 2008 which is enriched with spatial variables. Travel times by both private and public transport have been calculated on a congested network between residence and work locations. We find that household income positively influences vehicle ownership. Vicinity of train stops decrease the utility of owning a vehicle. Distance to residential car parks is not significant as is distance to the nearest electronic road pricing gantry. In addition to these spatial variables, an entropy index has been calculated as well as the number of opportunities within walking distance of a household's residence.

Based on the fact that each driver of a following vehicle perceives closing-in or shying-away a leading vehicle in front of him/her, primarily due to changes in the apparent size of the leading vehicle, we improved the full velocity difference (FVD) model and presented a visual angle car-following model. This model is in view of the stimulus–response framework and uses the visual angle and the change rate of the visual angle as stimulus. Results from linear analysis showed that the neutral stability line is asymmetry and the width of the leading vehicle has a great impact on the stability of traffic flow. Numerical simulations obtained the same results as theoretical analysis clearly such as density wave, shrinking hysteresis, asymmetry and wide scattering. Thus, the introducing of the visual angle can explain some complex nature of traffic flow and contribute to the design of more realistic car-following models.},

abstract = {This article studies the role that luminous flux and inter-headlight width play in nighttime vehicle distance estimation. As part of the real setting devised for this study, participants were asked to estimate the distance between themselves and an approaching car, while the actual position of the oncoming vehicle was determined by means of a photocell system. The distances used for the study ranged from 60 m to 870 m. The results obtained point to the existence of a linear relationship between estimated and real distances with a slope close to 1. This suggests that participants were able to successfully estimate distances between themselves and the vehicle. However, their estimations were clearly affected by the amount of horizontal separation between the headlights. The participants tended to overestimate the distance when the headlights were farther apart, while underestimating it when the lights were closer together. Surprisingly enough, luminous flux variation seemed to be irrelevant to their estimations. This may have been due to the fact that our perceptive system is able to estimate dynamic variation in light emission more accurately than discrete spatial variation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Andersen2007,
abstract = {Objective: The present study developed and tested a model of car following by human drivers. Background: Previous models of car following are based on 3-D parameters such as lead vehicle speed and distance information, which are not directly available to a driver. In the present paper we present the driving by visual angle (DVA) model, which is based on the visual information (visual angle and rate of change of visual angle) available to the driver. Method: Two experiments in a driving simulator examined car-following performance in response to speed variations of a lead vehicle defined by a sum of sine wave oscillations and ramp acceleration functions. In addition, the model was applied to six driving events using real world-driving data. Results: The model provided a good fit to car-following performance in the driving simulation studies as well as in real-world driving performance. A comparison with the advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN) model, which is based on 3-D parameters, suggests that the DVA was more predictive of driver behavior in matching lead vehicle speed and distance headway. Conclusion: Car-following behavior can be modeled using only visual information to the driver and can produce performance more predictive of driver performance than models based on 3-D (speed or distance) information. Application: The DVA model has applications to several traffic safety issues, including automated driving systems and traffic flow models.

Four quantitative variables are developed to measure four dimensions of urban form at the metropolitan level: metropolitan size, activity intensity, the degree that activities are evenly distributed, and the extent that high-density sub-areas are clustered. Through a series of simulation analyses, the global Moran coefficient, which characterises the fourth dimension, distinguishes compactness from sprawl. It is high, intermediate and close to zero for monocentric, polycentric and decentralised sprawling forms respectively. In addition, the more there is more local sprawl, composed of discontinuity and strip development, the lower is the Moran coefficient.},

abstract = {Emissions by road traffic can be reduced by optimising traffic control. The impact of this optimisation on emission can be analysed ex ante by simulation. The simulation programs used for this analysis should be valid with respect to the traffic characteristics that determine the emissions. Thus calibration of the parameters is a prerequisite. In most cases, volumes, travel times and queues are used to calibrate simulation models, rather than detailed driving characteristics such as speed and acceleration patterns. However, these driving behaviour parameters determine the vehicular emissions to a great extent.A study was carried out in which the driving behaviour parameters in a microscopic simulation model (VISSIM) were calibrated using real trajectories collected by image processing at an intersection in Rotterdam. The sensitivity of the simulation results for driving behaviour parameters was investigated. The most influential parameters were identified and adjusted to ensure that the simulation results were consistent with the observed traffic and could provide valid estimations of the total production of emissions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This contrasts with the methods used to calibrate most conventional models. The analysis focuses on determining possible causal factors, beyond the kinematic variables most often used, that could play a role in real traffic. These factors include various human characteristics (e.g., gender and distractions related to in-vehicle conditions like telephoning and vehicle occupancy); traffic and road characteristics (e.g., type of vehicle, congestion level, and location of driving lane); and environmental characteristics (e.g., time of day and weather conditions). The paper shows the magnitudes of the relationships that are discovered and offers suggestions as to how these results might contribute to the development of better models.},

abstract = {Because the driver's gap-acceptance maneuver is a complex and risky driving behavior, it is a highly concerned topic for traffic safety and operation. Previous studies have mainly focused on the driver's gap acceptance decision itself but did not pay attention to the maneuver process and driving behaviors. Using a driving simulator experiment for left-turn gap acceptance at a stop-controlled intersection, this study evaluated the effects of major traffic speed and driver age and gender on gap acceptance behaviors. The experiment results illustrate relationships among drivers' left-turn gap decision, driver's acceleration rate, steering action, and the influence of the gap-acceptance maneuver on the vehicles in the major traffic stream. The experiment results identified an association between high crash risk and high traffic speed at stop-controlled intersections. The older drivers, especially older female drivers, displayed a conservative driving attitude as a compensation for reduced driving ability, but also showed to be the most vulnerable group for the relatively complex driving maneuvers. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The concept “free vehicle” is used widely in the transportation research literature, but as yet there is no common standard for a definition. In this article a standard is provided that is based on the assumption that a vehicle can be considered free, when its speed is not influenced by the speed of the vehicle traveling ahead. In order to determine empirically a threshold for free vehicles in urban areas, speed, distance headway, and time headway data of more than 100000 vehicles were analyzed. Analyses showed that the speeds of two vehicles are linearly dependent on time headway for headways up to 6 s. It is important to distinguish between this value and the drivers' preferred headway, which is in the region of 2 s.},

abstract = {Trucks represent the predominant mode of domestic freight movement. Because of the substantial increase in freight truck traffic on the nation's highways, its influence on traffic flow performance, safety, and the quality of the travel experience is receiving increased attention. The behavior of non-truck drivers is modeled in terms of their interactions with trucks in the traffic stream; existing microscopic freeway traffic flow modeling logic is extended to incorporate these interactions; and alternative strategies to mitigate them are evaluated. The car-truck interactions are modeled by associating a "discomfort level" for every non-truck driver in the vicinity of trucks. This discomfort is affected by driver socioeconomic characteristics and situational factors such as time of day, weather, and ambient traffic congestion levels. Stated-preference surveys of non-truck drivers were used to elicit the factors that influence their behavior when they interact with trucks on highways. A fuzzy logic-based model was used to determine non-truck driver discomfort level. The model characterizes non-truck driver behavior near trucks by using if-then rules constructed with the survey data. The discomfort level is used in conjunction with the car-following and lane-changing logics of a traditional traffic flow model to generate a truck-following model and a corresponding lane-changing model. This redresses a key methodological gap in the literature and provides a capability to analyze alternative strategies to mitigate car-truck interactions. An agent-based freeway segment traffic flow simulator was constructed by using these extended microscopic flow models. Simulation experiments with data from the Borman Expressway (I-80 and I-94) in northwest Indiana were used to analyze the sensitivity of the model to the various parameters and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd. Microscopic traffic simulation models require the calibration of car-following (or vehicle-following) models. The parameters of vehicle-following models control individual driver's spacing, time gap, speed variation and acceleration during different driving conditions. In recent studies, these parameters have been determined for different vehicle classes separately since heavy vehicles generally keep longer spacing and time gap than light vehicles. These parameters have been commonly estimated based on the observed macroscopic traffic flow data such as average volume and speed. However, these data cannot reflect actual vehicle-following behavior of individual vehicles. Also, the effect of the lead vehicle class on the following vehicle's behavior has been neglected in the parameter estimation. Thus, this study estimates the driving behavior parameters for cars and heavy vehicles in the Wiedemann 99 vehicle-following model. For the estimation, 2169 vehicle trajectories were obtained from a 640-m segment of US-101 in Los Angeles, California during the morning peak hours. Separate parameters were estimated for three vehicle classes (cars, heavy vehicles, and motorcycles) and three vehicle-following cases (car following car, car following heavy vehicle, and heavy vehicle following car). From the comparison of the driving behavior parameters between cars and heavy vehicles, it was found that heavy vehicles keep longer spacing and time gap with the lead vehicle, are less sensitive to the lead car behavior, and apply smaller acceleration when they start from stationary position compared to cars. It was also found that the parameters significantly varied across different vehicle pairs even for the same vehicle class and the same vehicle-following case. The estimated parameters were also validated as the VISSIM simulation with the estimated parameters better reflected the observed cumulative average speed and acceleration distributions than the simulation with the default parameters. The results indicate that differences in the parameters among different vehicle-following cases and the variability of parameters for different vehicle pairs must be considered in the fixed parameters for each vehicle class currently used in the Wiedemann's model.},

abstract = {Traffic crash statistics and previous research have shown an increased risk of traffic crashes at signalized intersections. How to diagnose safety problems and develop effective countermeasures to reduce crash rate at intersections is a key task for traffic engineers and researchers. This study aims at investigating whether the driving simulator can be used as a valid tool to assess traffic safety at signalized intersections. In support of the research objective, this simulator validity study was conducted from two perspectives, a traffic parameter (speed) and a safety parameter (crash history). A signalized intersection with as many important features (including roadway geometries, traffic control devices, intersection surroundings, and buildings) was replicated into a high-fidelity driving simulator. A driving simulator experiment with eight scenarios at the intersection were conducted to determine if the subjects' speed behavior and traffic risk patterns in the driving simulator were similar to what were found at the real intersection. The experiment results showed that speed data observed from the field and in the simulator experiment both follow normal distributions and have equal means for each intersection approach, which validated the driving simulator in absolute terms. Furthermore, this study used an innovative approach of using surrogate safety measures from the simulator to contrast with the crash analysis for the field data. The simulator experiment results indicated that compared to the right-turn lane with the low rear-end crash history record (2 crashes), subjects showed a series of more risky behaviors at the right-turn lane with the high rear-end crash history record (16 crashes), including higher deceleration rate (1.80 ?? 1.20 m/s2 versus 0.80 ?? 0.65 m/s2), higher non-stop right-turn rate on red (81.67{\%} versus 57.63{\%}), higher right-turn speed as stop line (18.38 ?? 8.90 km/h versus 14.68 ?? 6.04 km/h), shorter following distance (30.19 ?? 13.43 m versus 35.58 ?? 13.41 m), and higher rear-end probability (9/59 = 0.153 versus 2/60 = 0.033). Therefore, the relative validity of driving simulator was well established for the traffic safety studies at signalized intersections. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a statistical model explaining the relationships between certain driver characteristics and behaviors, crash severity, and injury severity. Applying techniques of categorical data analysis to comprehensive data on crashes in Hawaii during 1990, we build a structural model relating driver characteristics and behaviors to type of crash and injury severity. The structural model helps to clarify the role of driver characteristics and behaviors in the causal sequence leading to more severe injuries. From the model we estimate the effects of various factors in terms of odds multipliers—that is, how much does each factor increase or decrease the odds of more severe crash types and injuries. We found that driver behaviors of alcohol or drug use and lack of seat belt use greatly increase the odds of more severe crashes and injuries. Driver errors are found to have a small effect, while personal characteristics of age and sex are generally insignificant. We conclude with a discussion of our modeling approach and of the implications of our findings for appropriate traffic safety interventions and future research.},

abstract = {Microscopic simulation models have been widely used in both transportation operations and management analyses because simulation is safer, less expensive, and faster than field implementation and testing. While these simulation models can be advantageous to engineers, the models must be calibrated and validated before they can be used to provide meaningful results. However, the transportation profession has not established any formal or consistent guidelines for the development and application of these models. In practice, simulation model-based analyses have often been conducted under default parameter values or bestguessed values. This is mainly due to either difficulties in field data collection or lack of a readily available procedure for simulation model calibration and validation. A procedure was proposed for microscopic simulation model calibration and validation and an example case study is presented with real-world traffic data from Route 50 on Lee Jackson Highway in Fairfax, Virginia. The proposed procedure consisted of nine steps: ( a ) measure of effectiveness selection, ( b ) data collection, ( c ) calibration parameter identification, ( d ) experimental design, ( e ) run simulation, ( f ) surface function development, ( g ) candidate parameter set generations, ( h ) evaluation, and ( i ) validation through new data collection.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to define and estimate a surrogate measure. By imposing a hypothetical disturbance to the leading vehicle, the following vehicle's action is represented as a probabilistic causal model. After that, a tree is built to describe the eight possible conflict types under the model. The surrogate measure, named Aggregated Crash Index (ACI), is thus proposed to measure the crash risk. This index reflects the accommodability of freeway traffic state to a traffic disturbance. We further apply this measure to evaluate the crash risks in a freeway section of Pacific Motorway, Australia. The results show that the proposed indicator outperforms the three traditional crash surrogate measures (i.e., Time to Collision, Proportion of Stopping Distance, and Crash Potential Index) in representing rear-end crash risks. The applications of this measure are also discussed.},

abstract = {Traffic flow oscillations, including traffic waves, are a common yet incompletely understood feature of congested traffic. Possible mechanisms include traffic flow instabilities, indifference regions or finite human perception thresholds (action points), and external acceleration noise. However, the relative importance of these factors in a given situation remains unclear. We bring light into this question by adding external noise and action points to the Intelligent Driver Model and other car-following models thereby obtaining a minimal model containing all three oscillation mechanisms. We show analytically that even in the subcritical regime of linearly stable flow (order parameter ϵ {\textless} 0), external white noise leads to spatiotemporal speed correlations «anticipating» the waves of the linearly unstable regime. Sufficiently far away from the threshold, the amplitude scales with (-ϵ)-0.5. By means of simulations and comparisons with experimental car platoons and bicycle traffic, we show that external noise and indifference regions with action points have essentially equivalent effects. Furthermore, flow instabilities dominate the oscillations on freeways while external noise or action points prevail at low desired speeds such as vehicular city or bicycle traffic. For bicycle traffic, noise can lead to fully developed waves even for single-file traffic in the subcritical regime.},

The results show that the thresholds are not constant, but vary over different speeds. Another interesting note is that the variance over the speeds appears to be driver dependent.

Although there is a long tradition of research into human road user interactions, there is a lack of shared models and terminology to support cross-disciplinary research and development towards safe and acceptable interaction-capable HAVs. Here, we review the main themes and findings in previous theoretical and empirical interaction research, and find large variability in perspectives and terminologies. We unify these perspectives in a structured, cross-theoretical conceptual framework, describing what road traffic interactions are, how they arise, and how they get resolved. Two key contributions are: (1) a stringent definition of “interaction”, as “a situation where the behaviour of at least two road users can be interpreted as being influenced by the possibility that they are both intending to occupy the same region of space at the same time in the near future”, and (2) a taxonomy of the types of behaviours that road users exhibit in interactions. We hope that this conceptual framework will be useful in the development of improved empirical methodology, theoretical models, and technical requirements on vehicle automation.},

abstract = {Traffic simulation models make assumptions about the safety-related behaviour of drivers. These assumptions may or may not replicate the real behaviour of those drivers who adopt seemingly unsafe behaviour, for example running red lights at signalised intersections or too closely following the vehicles in front. Such behaviour results in the performance of the system that we observe but will often result in conflicts and very occasionally in accidents. The question is whether these models should reflect safe behaviour or actual behaviour. Good design should seek to enhance safety, but is the safety of a design necessarily enhanced by making unrealistically optimistic assumptions about the safety of drivers' behaviour? This paper explores the questions associated with the choice of values for safety-related parameters in simulation models. The paper identifies the key parameters of traffic simulation models and notes that several of them have been derived from theory or informed guesswork rather than observation of real behaviour and that, even where they are based on observations, these may have been conducted in circumstances quite different to those which now apply. Tests with the micro-simulation model DRACULA demonstrate the sensitivity of model predictions—and perhaps policy decisions—to the value of some of the key parameters. It is concluded that, in general, it is better to use values that are realistic-but-unsafe than values that are safe-but-unrealistic. Although the use of realistic-but-unsafe parameter values could result in the adoption of unsafe designs, this problem can be overcome by paying attention to the safety aspects of designs. The possibility of using traffic simulation models to produce estimates of accident potential and the difficulties involved in doing so are discussed.},

abstract = {Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a distance measure that compares two time series after optimally aligning them. DTW is being used for decades in thousands of academic and industrial projects despite the very expensive computational complexity, O(n2). These applications include data mining, image processing, signal processing, robotics and computer graphics among many others. In spite of all this research effort, there are many myths and misunderstanding about DTW in the literature, for example "it is too slow to be useful" or "the warping window size does not matter much." In this tutorial, we correct these misunderstandings and we summarize the research efforts in optimizing both the efficiency and effectiveness of both the basic DTW algorithm, and of the higher-level algorithms that exploit DTW such as similarity search, clustering and classification. We will discuss variants of DTW such as constrained DTW, multidimensional DTW and asynchronous DTW, and optimization techniques such as lower bounding, early abandoning, run-length encoding, bounded approximation and hardware optimization. We will discuss a multitude of application areas including physiological monitoring, social media mining, activity recognition and animal sound processing. The optimization techniques are generalizable to other domains on various data types and problems.},

abstract = {In attempting to simulate the operation of a dynamic route guidance system, the modelling task is concerned both with the operation of the control system and with the implications this has for modelling driver behaviour (whether or not the driver is receiving information from the controller) and network conditions. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the modelling issues which need to be considered when addressing such a problem, and which have been identified by various authors in reports on experimental/survey work and in discussion papers. In discussing the great number of challenges to the modelling world which have arisen from the interest in such systems, we seek to stimulate further discussion and to provide a framework within which any route guidance model may be critically evaluated. We consider such a framework to be particularly timely in the light of the wealth of simulation models currently being proposed - and widely varying conclusions being drawn - as a result of many major research initiatives currently underway throughout the developed world. It is our belief that the development of a model which adequately represents the performance of a dynamic route guidance system is of the utmost importance to the success of such an approach. It will not only provide a means for evaluating the potential benefits, but should also provide an essential insight into the most appropriate means for its implementation and improve our understanding of transportation networks.},

abstract = {In his review on driver brake reaction times (RTs), Green (2000) rightly criticizes attempts to seek a canonical brake RT, and proposes to determine expected brake RT for specific situations. However, based on his analysis, he presents a series of values for expected, unexpected, and surprise situations that appear to generalize over a variety of different driver tasks and traffic situations without sufficient concern for urgency or criticality of the situations. This sampling problem may lead easily to biased and somewhat arbitrary estimates. Thus, instead of 1.25 sec for "unexpected" situations, the median yellow response time for the critical conditions (at short time-to-stop-line) is rather below 1.0 sec, and instead of 1.5 sec mean brake RT for surprise situations, available on-road data suggest that in fairly urgent situations-at time-to-collision of about 4.0 sec-unalerted drivers are able to react to an obstacle by braking at an average latency of 1.0 to 1.3 sec, depending on site. More emphasis should be given to analyzing (and producing) real-life data on driver reactions as a function of situational and driver-centered variables, and of criticality.},

abstract = {It is assumed that the velocity of a car at time t is some (nonlinear) function of the spacial headway at time t- $\Delta$, so the equations of motion for a sequence of cars consists of a set of differential-difference equations. There is a special family of velocity-headway relations that agrees well with experimental data for steady flow, and that also gives differential equations which for $\Delta$ =0 can be solved explicitly. Some exact solutions of these equations show that a small amplitude disturbance propagates through a series of cars in the manner described by linear theories except that the dependence of the wave velocity on the car velocity causes an accleration wave to spread as it propagates and a deceleration wave to form a stable shock. These conclusions are then shown to hold for quite general types of velocity-headway relations, and to yield a theory that in certain limiting cases gives all the results of the linear car-following theories and in other cases all the features of the nonlinear continuum theories, plus a detailed picture of the shock structure.},

abstract = {The car-following behavior of individual drivers in real city traffic is studied on the basis of (publicly available) trajectory data sets recorded by a vehicle equipped with a radar sensor. By means of a nonlinear optimization procedure based on a genetic algorithm, the intelligent driver model and the velocity difference model are calibrated by minimizing the deviations between the observed driving dynamics and the simulated trajectory in following the same leading vehicle. The reliability and robustness of the nonlinear fits are assessed by applying different optimization criteria, that is, different measures for the deviations between two trajectories. The obtained errors are between 11{\%} and 29{\%}, which is consistent with typical error ranges obtained in previous studies. It is also found that the calibrated parameter values of the velocity difference model depend strongly on the optimization criterion, whereas the intelligent driver model is more robust. The influence of a reaction time is investigated by applying an explicit delay to the model input. A negligible influence of the reaction time is found and indicates that drivers compensate for their reaction time by anticipation. Furthermore, the parameter sets calibrated to a certain trajectory are applied to the other trajectories; this step allows for model validation. The results indicate that intradriver variability rather than interdriver variability accounts for a large part of the calibration errors. The results are used to suggest some criteria toward a benchmarking of car-following models.},

abstract = {This study aims at 'predicting' the occurrence of lane-change related freeway crashes using the traffic surveillance data collected from a pair of dual loop detectors. The approach adopted here involves developing classification models using the historical crash data and corresponding information on real-time traffic parameters obtained from loop detectors. The historical crash and loop detector data to calibrate the neural network models (corresponding to crash and non-crash cases to set up a binary classification problem) were collected from the Interstate-4 corridor in Orlando (FL) metropolitan area. Through a careful examination of crash data, it was concluded that all sideswipe collisions and the angle crashes that occur on the inner lanes (left most and center lanes) of the freeway may be attributed to lane-changing maneuvers. These crashes are referred to as lane-change related crashes in this study. The factors explored as independent variables include the parameters formulated to capture the overall measure of lane-changing and between-lane variations of speed, volume and occupancy at the station located upstream of crash locations. Classification tree based variable selection procedure showed that average speeds upstream and downstream of crash location, difference in occupancy on adjacent lanes and standard deviation of volume and speed downstream of the crash location were found to be significantly associated with the binary variable (crash versus non-crash). The classification models based on data mining approach achieved satisfactory classification accuracy over the validation dataset. The results indicate that these models may be applied for identifying real-time traffic conditions prone to lane-change related crashes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Scaling influences and often controls the way objects interact with their environments. The chapter reviews abstraction and scale, size and shape, size and function, scaling, and conditions that are imposed at an object's boundary, and some of the consequences of choosing scales in both theory and experimental measurements. It demonstrates how scaling effects influenced the growth of cathedrals and large churches and how size affects function in the ability of birds to hover and in people's ability to hear and to speak. Scaling has a significant effect on experiments, both in terms of how data is acquired and how it is interpreted. The choice of scale(s) for experiments is a crucial part of the design of experiments. The way that data is scaled for presentation can significantly influence how people perceive the meaning of that data. This is also a very important part of modeling because it speaks directly to the perceived credibility of the results of any modeling endeavor.},

@article{Wegener2004,
abstract = {The previous chapters in this Handbook have shown that spatial development, or land use, determines the need for spatial interaction, or transport, but that transport, by the accessibility it provides, also determines spatial development. However, it is difficult to empirically isolate impacts of land use on transport and vice versa because of the multitude of concurrent changes of other factors. This poses a problem if the likely impacts of integrated land-use and transport policies to reduce the demand for travel are to be predicted. There are principally three methods to predict those impacts. The first is to ask people how they would change their location and mobility behaviour if certain factors, such as land use regulations or transport costs, would change ('stated preference'). The second consists of drawing conclusions from observed decision behaviour of people under different conditions on how they would be likely to behave if these factors would change ('revealed preference'). The third method is to simulate human decision behaviour in mathematical models. All three methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Surveys can reveal also subjective factors of location and mobility decisions, however, their respondents can only make conjec- tures about how they would behave in still unknown situations, and the validity of such con- jectures is uncertain. Empirical studies based on observation of behaviour produce detailed and reliable results; these, however, are valid only for existing situations and are therefore not suited for the assessment of novel yet untested policies. In addition it is usually not possible to associate the observed changes of behaviour unequivocally with specific causes, because in reality several determining factors change at the same time. Mathematical models of human behaviour are also based on empirical surveys or observa- tions. The difference is that the conclusions to be drawn from the survey and observation data are quantified. Strictly speaking, the results of mathematical models are no more universally valid than those of empirical studies but are only valid for situations which are similar to those for which their parameters were estimated. Nevertheless it is possible to transfer human be- haviour represented in mathematical models within certain limits to still unknown situations. In addition, mathematical models are the only method by which the effects of individual de- termining factors can be analysed by keeping all other factors fixed. In this chapter recent developments in the field of operational integrated land-use transport models will be reviewed with special emphasis on their ability to test both land use and trans- port policies and to assess their impacts.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews some mathematical techniques such as dimensional homogeneity, abstraction and scaling, conservation and balance principles, and consequences of linearity. Modeling is a cognitive activity of thinking about and making models to describe how devices or objects of interest behave. There are many ways in which devices and behaviors can be described. Words, drawings or sketches, physical models, computer programs, or mathematical formulas can be used for this purpose. In other words, modeling activity can be done in several languages, often simultaneously. A mathematical model is a representation in mathematical terms of the behavior of real devices and objects. In the practices of science and of engineering design, models are often applied to predict what will happen in a future situation. In engineering design, however, the predictions are used in ways that have far different consequences than simply anticipating the outcome of an experiment. Various tools for modeling, such as dimensional analysis, abstraction and scaling, balance laws, and linearity are outlined in the chapter.},

abstract = {The preferred time-headway of drivers in highway conditions is related to the likelihood of rear-end collisions. We studied traffic data from a section of southbound highway 101- a heavily commuted eight-lane freeway between San Francisco and the Silicon valley in California. We observed two parameters that drivers regulate during free flow, rush hour, and heavy traffic conditions: (1) the speed of their vehicle; and (2) the time-headway to the preceding vehicle. During free flow traffic, the preferred speeds show low variation within lanes, but large variations from lane to lane. During rush hour traffic, the time-headway between vehicles varies between 1 and 2 s for a range of traffic speeds. For all traffic conditions a lower limit of 1s is seen in time-headway, even when traffic volume does not push drivers toward tight spacing. The lower limit of 1s is consistent with what was found in several previous studies, but is significantly shorter than the 3s headway that is recommended by driving manuals. The short time-headways observed are within the limit of typical reaction time for braking by alert drivers, but probably lead to occasional accidents given variability in reaction times, decisions, and vehicle braking capabilities, especially when preview information is not available},

abstract = {tions occur about an equilibrium point. The oscillations may be periodic such as the motion of a pendulum or random such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road. More often, vibration is undesirable, wasting energy and creating unwanted sound—noise. Careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations. This chapter illustrates the example of the classical pendulum as a mathematical model derived, grounded in, and verified against experimental results, and the process of obtaining qualitative information about its behavior. The chapter demonstrates the behavior of linear oscillators in several domains, and draws some distinctions between the behaviors exhibited by linear and nonlinear models. The concepts of linearity, dimensional consistency, scaling, and some basic ideas of second-order differential equations are used for this purpose. In terms of the behavior of the pendulum itself, the period of the linear model depends only on the pendulum's properties and not on its amplitude of vibration, as is the case for nonlinear models wherein the amplitude is large. For both, the two-mass pendulum and a predator-prey population system, the period of the vibrating system is sensitive to properties of that system—especially for the two-mass pendulum, for which instability occurs for certain combinations of masses.},

abstract = {This paper examines the potential effectiveness of the following three precollision system (PCS) algorithms: 1) forward collision warning only; 2) forward collision warning and precrash brake assist; and 3) forward collision warning, precrash brake assist, and autonomous precrash brake. Real-world rear-end crashes were extracted from a nationally representative sample of collisions in the United States. A sample of 1396 collisions, corresponding to 1.1 million crashes, were computationally simulated as if they occurred, with the driver operating a precollision-system-equipped vehicle. A probability-based framework was developed to account for the variable driver reaction to the warning system. As more components were added to the algorithms, greater benefits were realized. The results indicate that the exemplar PCS investigated in this paper could reduce the severity (i.e., $\Delta$V) of the collision between 14{\%} and 34{\%}. The number of moderately to fatally injured drivers who wore their seat belts could have been reduced by 29{\%} to 50{\%}. These collision-mitigating algorithms could have prevented 3.2{\%} to 7.7{\%} of rear-end collisions. This paper shows the dramatic reductions in serious and fatal injuries that a PCS, which is one of the first intelligent vehicle technologies to be deployed in production cars, can bring to highway safety when available throughout the fleet. This paper also presents the framework of an innovative safety benefits methodology that, when adapted to other emerging active safety technologies, can be employed to estimate potential reductions in the frequency and severity of highway crashes. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {This contribution analyzes the widely used and well-known "intelligent driver model (briefly IDM), which is a second order car-following model governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Although this model was intensively studied in recent years for properly capturing traffic phenomena and driver braking behavior, a rigorous study of the well-posedness has, to our knowledge, never been performed. First it is shown that, for a specific class of initial data, the vehicles' velocities become negative or even diverge to {\$}-\backslashinfty{\$} in finite time, both undesirable properties for a car-following model. Various modifications of the IDM are then proposed in order to avoid such ill-posedness. The theoretical remediation of the model, rather than post facto by ad-hoc modification of code implementations, allows a more sound numerical implementation and preservation of the model features. Indeed, to avoid inconsistencies and ensure dynamics close to the one of the original model, one may need to inspect and clean large input data, which may result in practically impossible scenarios for large-scale simulations. Although well-posedness issues occur only for specific initial data, this may happen frequently when different traffic scenarios are analyzed, and especially in presence of lane-changing, on ramps and other network components as it is the case for most commonly used micro-simulators. On the other side, it is shown that well-posedness can be guaranteed by straight-forward improvements, such as those obtained by slightly changing the acceleration to prevent the velocity from becoming negative.},

abstract = {The traffic flow heterogeneity caused by vehicle type difference has drawn increasing attention recently. This paper uses real data to explore the characteristics of the traffic flow consisting of the four types of car-truck car-following combinations, car-following-car (CC), car-following-truck (CT), truck-following-car (TC) and truck-following-truck (TT). To overwhelm the shortcoming that the existing car-following model, Optimal Velocity Model, cannot reflect the complexity of real heterogeneous traffic flow, a new model is proposed based on a nonlinear ordinary differential car-following model, Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectory data is applied to calibrate and evaluate the proposed model. Based on the calibrated model, the traffic regime, linear stability, fundamental diagrams, and shock wave characteristics of the car-truck heterogeneous traffic flow are investigated. The results reveal some new findings of the car-truck heterogeneous traffic flow. The mixture of congested and free flow regime occurs when the trucks reach their maximum speeds. Cars and trucks can both stabilize and destabilize the traffic flow, depending on the combination type and the equilibrium velocity. Moreover, the fundamental diagrams of different car-truck combinations converge to several clusters with the same proportion difference between the CC and TT combinations. The speeding-up effect of trucks on shock wave propagation in the car-truck heterogeneous traffic flow is observed in the simulation.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses elementary mathematical approximation techniques, model testing, and validation. It also reviews the means of model validation: checking dimensions and units, testing qualitative behavior and limits, and applying basic statistics. The chapter outlines the importance of numerical approximations and of significant figures, especially in the context of their proper display and interpretation. Many analytical approximations are derived from Taylor's formulas. Advanced numerical techniques such as the finite element method also use Taylor's formulas to approximate functions as polynomials with unknown coefficients that are determined numerically. The chapter also highlights the importance of Taylor and algebraic series expansions, including application to stretched rings (Taylor series of hyperbolic functions), gravitational forces (binomial expressions), and thermal expansion (algebraic approximations). The chapter then emphasizes the need to validate models, and discusses the roles played by dimensional and qualitative analyses in model validation. Working with mathematical models means the constant use of numbers that derive from calculations or experiments. These numbers always incorporate error. In this context, the chapter explains random and systematic errors, and discusses how they affect the precision and accuracy of any set of data. Finally, the chapter takes a look at statistical techniques to quantify such errors and illustrates examples using least squares method and continuum hypothesis to develop statistically based numerical approximations..},

abstract = {This study aims to propose a new algorithm to evaluate the rear-end collision risk under fog conditions considering reduced visibility. The proposed algorithm compares the safe stopping distance of the leading and following vehicles. According to the relationship between clearance distance between the two consecutive vehicles and visibility distance, the car-following maneuver is divided into different situations and the algorithms to calculate the safe stopping distances are suggested correspondingly. The visibility distance is collected by a new visibility detection system with adaptive learning modules and the clearance distance is obtained from a vehicle-based detector. By comparing the safe stopping distances of the following and leading vehicles, the potential rear-end collision can be identified. Subsequently, statistical tests are conducted to analyze rear-end collision risk and compare the different impact of reduced visibility on the collision risk for different vehicle types and lanes. Furthermore, random parameters logistic and negative binomial models are estimated by using individual vehicle data and aggregated traffic flow data, respectively, in order to explore the relationship between the potential rear-end crash and the reduced visibility together with other traffic parameters. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm works well in evaluating rear-end collision risk under fog conditions. It is found that reduced visibility has significant impact on the rear-end collision risk and the impact vary by the different vehicle types and by lane. Further, it is concluded that the driving maneuver of the leading and following vehicles can affect the rear-end collision risk. It is expected that the proposed algorithm can be implemented in a Traffic Management context to improve road safety under fog conditions. Specifically, it is suggested to implement the proposed algorithms in real-time and integrate it with ITS technologies such as Variable Speed Limit (VSL) and Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) to enhance traffic safety when the visibility declines. This car following algorithm could also be extended to adapt for the advent of Connected Vehicles in Fog conditions.},

abstract = {This study develops the method of estimating lane change duration (LCD) and analyzes the impact of surrounding trucks on car driver's LCD. Driver behavior data were collected from 50 drivers using a driving simulator. Drivers tested two scenarios – the scenario with surrounding cars only (Cars scenario) and the scenario with surrounding trucks only (Trucks scenario). Lateral positions of the subject and surrounding vehicles in 270 discretionary and mandatory lane changes were extracted from vehicle trajectories. The start and end times of each lane change were estimated using a constrained-slope piecewise regression model. It was found that the LCD was generally shorter for the Trucks scenario than the Cars scenario. This is potentially because car drivers are more likely to avoid conflicts with trucks by changing lanes faster. Linear regression models were also developed to identify the association of the LCD with driver and lane-change characteristics, vehicle dynamics and traffic kinematics at 4 different time frames - 0.5 s before start, start, middle (cross the lane marking) and end of lane change. The model results show that the LCD increases with the time gap in origin lane at the middle time frame only in the Cars scenario. However, the LCD was shorter when the time gap in origin lane was shorter, speed of subject vehicle was higher and accelerator pedal was pressed 0.5 s before start, start and middle time frames in the Trucks scenario. This study demonstrates that type of surrounding vehicles must be considered for estimation of the LCD.},

The accuracy of a traffic-simulation system depends highly on the quality of the traffic-flow model at its core, with the two main critical components being the car-following and lane-changing models. This paper presents findings from a com- parative evaluation of car-following behavior in a number of traffic simulators [advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN), parallel microscopic simulation (PARAMICS), and Verkehr in Stadten—simulation (VISSIM)]. The car-following algorithms used in these simulators have been developed from a variety of theoretical backgrounds and are reported to have been calibrated on a number of different data sets. Very few independent studies have attempted to eval- uate the performance of the underlying algorithms based on the same data set. The results reported in this study are based on a car-following experiment that used instrumented vehicles to record the speed and relative distance between follower and leader vehicles on a one-lane road. The experiment was replicated in each tool and the simulated car-following behavior was com- pared to the field data using a number of error tests. The results showed lower error values for the Gipps-based models imple- mented in AIMSUN and similar error values for the psychophysi- cal spacing models used in VISSIM and PARAMICS.Aqualitative “drift and goal-seeking behavior” test, which essentially shows how the distance headway between leader and follower vehicles should oscillate around a stable distance, also confirmed the findings.},

abstract = {This book takes its title from the last lecture by Allen Newell, one of the pioneers of cognitive science. He said, "The question for me is how can the human mind occur in the physical universe? We now know that the world is governed by physics. We now understand the way biology nestles comfortably within that. The issue is how will the mind do that as well?" Newell argued that the answer to his question must take the form of a cognitive architecture, and this book describes an answer that is emerging from the study of brain and behavior. Humans share the same basic cognitive architecture with all primates, but they have evolved abilities to exercise abstract control over cognition and process more complex relational patterns. The human cognitive architecture consists of a set of largely independent modules associated with different brain regions. The book discusses in detail how these various modules can combine to produce behaviors as varied as driving a car and solving an algebraic equation, but focuses principally on two of the modules: declarative and procedural. The declarative module involves a memory system that, moment by moment, attempts to give each person the most appropriate possible window into his or her past. The procedural module involves a central system that strives to develop a set of productions that will enable the most adaptive response from any state of the modules. {\textcopyright} 2007 by John R.

abstract = {Over the past decades there has been a considerable development in the modeling of car-following (CF) behavior as a result of research undertaken by both traffic engineers and traffic psychologists. While traffic engineers seek to understand the behavior of a traffic stream, traffic psychologists seek to describe the human abilities and errors involved in the driving process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these two research streams. It is necessary to consider human-factors in CF modeling for a more realistic representation of CF behavior in complex driving situations (for example, in traffic breakdowns, crash-prone situations, and adverse weather conditions) to improve traffic safety and to better understand widely-reported puzzling traffic flow phenomena, such as capacity drop, stop-and-go oscillations, and traffic hysteresis. While there are some excellent reviews of CF models available in the literature, none of these specifically focuses on the human factors in these models. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing the available literature with a specific focus on the latest advances in car-following models from both the engineering and human behavior points of view. In so doing, it analyses the benefits and limitations of various models and highlights future research needs in the area.},

abstract = {The research presented in this paper proposes and develops a new car-following model, which we term the Fadhloun-Rakha (FR) model. The FR model incorporates the key components of the Rakha-Pasumarthy-Adjerid (RPA) model in that it uses the same steady state formulation, respects vehicle dynamics, and uses very similar collision-avoidance strategies to ensure safe following distances between vehicles. The main contributions of the FR model over the RPA model are the following: (1) it models the driver throttle and brake pedal input; (2) it captures driver variability; (3) it allows for shorter than steady-state following distances when following faster leading vehicles; (4) it offers a much smoother acceleration profile while converging to steady states; and (5) it explicitly captures driver perception and control inaccuracies and errors. Besides describing the methodology and the role of each of the model parameters, this study evaluates the performance of the new model using a naturalistic driving dataset. A brief comparative analysis was performed to validate the model with regard to replicating empirical driver and vehicle behavior. Through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation, the proposed FR model demonstrates a significant decrease in the modeling error when compared to the original RPA model and generates trajectories that are highly consistent with empirically observed car-following behavior.},

abstract = {Rear-end collisions account for about one-third of all traffic crashes on a yearly basis. It has been apparent for some time that the key to perceiving a slower vehicle ahead of us as an imminent hazard, i.e., one requiring immediate action, is a sufficient rate of change of the visual angle of the lead vehicle. This is known as the “looming threshold”, among other things. A number of laboratory researchers have reported values of the looming threshold to be in the range of 0.003 radian/sec. Forensic practitioners routinely use elevated values of the looming threshold, e.g., 0.005-0.008, to account for the complexity of real-world driving tasks. However, only one source has used data from actual vehicle accidents to arrive at a looming threshold – and that value, 0.0275 rad/sec, is an order of magnitude larger than that derived from laboratory studies. In this study, we examine a much broader range of real-world accident data to obtain an estimate of the reasonable upper end of the looming threshold. The results show a range of 0.0397 to 0.0117 rad/sec, for presumed perception-reaction times (PRTs) of 0.75 and 2.0 seconds, respectively. We discuss the implications for forensic human factors analysis of rear-end crashes.},

abstract = {Studies that model the effects of land use on commuting generally use a trip-based approach or a more aggregated individual-based approach: i. e. commuting is conceptualized in terms of modal choice, distance and time per single trip, or in terms of daily commuting distance or time. However, people try to schedule activities in a daily pattern and, thus, consider tours instead of trips. Data from the 2000 to 2001 Travel Behaviour Survey in Ghent (Belgium) illustrate that car use and commuting times significantly differ between commuting trips within work-only tours and more complex tours. Therefore, this paper considers trip-related decisions simultaneously with tour-related decisions. A multiple group structural equation model (SEM) confirmed that the relationship between land use and commuting differs between work-only tours and more complex tours. Trips should be considered within tours in order to correctly understand the effect of land use scenarios such as densifying on commuting. Moreover, the use of multiple group SEM enabled us to address the issue of the complex nature of commuting. Due to interactions between various explanatory variables, land use patterns do not always have the presumed effect on commuting. Land use policy can successfully influence commuting, but only if it simultaneously accounts for the effects on car availability, car use, commuting distance and commuting time. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

When brake strength was manipulated between participants using a simulated braking task, the ratio of ideal to maximum deceleration at brake onset was invariant across groups, suggesting that calibration involves scaling information about ideal deceleration in intrinsic units of maximum deceleration. Evidence of rapid recalibration was found when brake strength was manipulated within participants, and the presence of external forces that affect brake dynamics resulted in biases in performance. Discussion focuses on the role of calibration, internal models, and affordance perception in visually guided action.},

Using data from the 1991 Activity–Travel Survey in Boston, the study tested the role of spatial accessibility as a composite measure of urban form in explaining individuals' nonwork activity participation, travel times, and travel frequencies. The results showed varying effects of modifying spatial accessibility on nonwork activity participation and travel among different activity categories. When accessibility to schools improved, children and adults were found to pay more visits to and spent more times in schools yet without generating additional total school travel. However, for every standard deviation increase in accessibility to entertaining, recreational, eat-out, and other social opportunities, the odds were 1.23 times greater to engage in these activities than staying at home. In contrast, the odds were 0.79 for them to spend time in chauffeuring family members. There was a substitution relationship between work commute and nonwork travel when levels of accessibility changed. An increase in accessibility by 1 standard deviation was associated with a decrease in work commute by 2.23min, but increases in travel times for social activities by 2.07min and for shopping travel by 1.20min. The increase in social travel was due to more frequent trip making resulting from higher accessibility. Findings from the study underscore the importance of physical planning and design to improve spatial accessibility and to help divert the additional social travel induced by accessibility improvement to nondriving modes.},

It was indicated that the “acceleration cliff” was a source of the generated emission errors. The existence of the discrete regimes was responsible for the “acceleration cliff.” It was indicated that the “acceleration cliff” could not be eradicated by the parameter calibration, unless the logics of the regimes were modified. A data-driven model was designed based on the Wiedemann plane. The “acceleration cliffs” were successfully eliminated by implementing continuous accelerations.

abstract = {The detection of impending collisions and the subsequent choice and regulation of maneuvers to deal with them are general problems of locomotor control that arise in many situations, both human and non-human. When an object moves towards an observer, the size of the image that it projects onto the retina of the observer's eyes increases, providing a powerful sensation of motion [1]. Physiological and psychophysical research into this "looming" effect provides strong evidence for the existence of neural "looming detectors" that are used by humans and non-humans alike to detect and respond to oncoming objects [2, 3, 4]. Automotive applications constitute an important context for the study of the visual perception of looming. To date, however, this aspect of the driver's performance has largely been neglected. In this study we begin to address this deficiency by quantifying the visual system's ability to detect and track an object's approach, as represented by the rate of change of the angle ? that its image subtends on the retina of the eye. To focus our efforts we have assumed a fairly constrained driving scenario (the 'Lead Vehicle Braking" scenario), but these results are applicable to any scenario (automotive or not) in which the observer has an unobstructed view of the approach of an object or stationary obstacle.},

abstract = {As computing capabilities have advanced, random coefficient models have emerged as the mainstream method of dealing with traveler behaviors in transport studies. Car-following models with random coefficients, however, are rarely used, although many kinds of car-following models have been attempted. For the present study, we proposed a rigorous methodology to calibrate a GM-type car-following model with random coefficients, which could account for the heterogeneity across drivers who respond differently to stimuli. To avert both the curse of dimensionality and the lack of empirical identification, which can be a part of dealing with a simulated likelihood, a robust algorithm called the expectation-maximization (EM) was adopted. The calibration results confirmed that random coefficients of the model fluctuated considerably across drivers, and were correlated with each other. The exclusion of these facts might be a potential reason for the difficulty in simulating real traffic situations based on a single car-following model with constant coefficients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The driver-specific data available from naturalistic driving studies provide a unique perspective from which to test and calibrate car-following mod- els. As equipment and data storage costs continue to decline, the collection of data through in situ probe-type vehicles is likely to become more popu- lar, and thus there is a need to assess the feasibility of these data for the modeling of driver car-following behavior. This study focused on the costs and benefits of naturalistic data for use in mobility applications. Any proj- ect seeking to use naturalistic data should plan for a complex and poten- tially costly data reduction process to extract mobility data. A case study was based on data from the database of the 100-Car Study conducted by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. One thousand minutes' worth of data comprising more than 2,000 car-following events recorded across eight drivers from a section of multilane highway located near Washing- ton, D.C., was compiled. The collected event data were used to calibrate four different car-following models, and a comparative analysis of model performance was conducted. The results of model calibration are given in tabular format, displayed on the fundamental diagram, and shown with sample event charts of speed versus time and headway versus time. When compared with the Gipps, intelligent driver, and Gaxis–Herman–Rothery models, the Rakha–Pasumarthy–Adjerid model was found to perform best in matching individual drivers and in matching aggregate results.},

abstract = {Car-following models constitute the main component of operational microscopic simulation models and are intended to capture inter-vehicle interactions on highway sections. Most existing car-following models are deterministic in nature, and do not capture the effects of surrounding traffic conditions on the decision making process of the driver. This paper offers an extension to the sequential risk taking model introduced by Hamdar et al. (4), with an attempt to capture the effects of surrounding conditions on the driving behavior. It recognizes two behavioral regimes depending on the complexity of the decision situation associated with the prevailing congestion. With each regime is associated a different value function capturing driver preferences for gains associated with a particular acceleration. A probabilistic regime selection mechanism relates the driver's choices to prevailing traffic conditions. The model is calibrated against actual trajectory data. Initial results show that the model provides realistic behavioral patterns previously identified in the literature.},

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in the main areas of driving behaviour research: acceleration, lane changing and gap acceptance. Overall, the main limitation of current models is that in many cases they do not adequately capture the sophistication of human drivers: they do not capture the inter-dependencies among the decisions made by the same drivers over time and across decision dimensions, represent instantaneous decision making, which fails to capture drivers' planning and anticipation capabilities and only capture myopic considerations that do not account for extended driving goals and considerations. Furthermore, most models proposed in the literature were not estimated rigorously. In many cases, this is due to the limited availability of detailed trajectory data, which is required for estimation. Hence, data availability poses a significant obstacle to the advancement of driving behaviour modelling.},

abstract = {North American cities have undergone dramatic changes over the last century. Locations that were once inconvenient have become accessible through extensive road networks leading to population decentralization from the traditional urban centre to suburbia, creating polycentric sprawls from once monocentric communities. Hamilton, Ontario is one such city. The decentralization and urban decline of the city is widely attributed to sprawling development. This change in the sociospatial structure creates challenges for transportation planners as we see greater automobile dependency, greater commuting distances and increased congestion. Smart growth policies such as urban residential intensification (URI) aim to increase population densities in the urban core. This exploratory study estimates the benefits of such policies from a transportation aspect. It is predicted that the City of Hamilton will experience household growth of approximately 80,000 households over the period 2005–2031. Using IMULATE, an integrated urban transportation and land-use model, a variety of development scenarios model this anticipated growth. Changes in vehicular emissions, traffic congestion and energy consumption as a result of URI are examined. Models of the land-use/transportation relationship demonstrate how increasing population densities within a city's urban centre drastically reduce congestion, emissions and gasoline consumption.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. Objective: The aim of this study was to outline a conceptual framework for understanding driving style and, on this basis, review the state-of-the-art research on driving styles in relation to road safety. Background: Previous research has indicated a relationship between the driving styles adopted by drivers and their crash involvement. However, a comprehensive literature review of driving style research is lacking. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted, including empirical, theoretical, and methodological research, on driving styles related to road safety. Results: A conceptual framework was proposed whereby driving styles are viewed in terms of driving habits established as a result of individual dispositions as well as social norms and cultural values. Moreover, a general scheme for categorizing and operationalizing driving styles was suggested. On this basis, existing literature on driving styles and indicators was reviewed. Links between driving styles and road safety were identified and individual and sociocultural factors influencing driving style were reviewed. Conclusion: Existing studies have addressed a wide variety of driving styles, and there is an acute need for a unifying conceptual framework in order to synthesize these results and make useful generalizations. There is a considerable potential for increasing road safety by means of behavior modification. Naturalistic driving observations represent particularly promising approaches to future research on driving styles. Application: Knowledge about driving styles can be applied in programs for modifying driver behavior and in the context of usage-based  insurance. It may also be used as a means for driver identification and for the development of driver assistance systems.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to better understand the causes of driver errors in the context of rear-end crashes. When drivers move in traffic they generate an overall assessment of the driving situation and what will happen in the near future. Certain cues in the traffic environment may create an expectation that some specific action is required. The more relevant cues are present, the more the driver will expect that some kind of intervention may be required. In contrary, if hardly any or no relevant cues are present, the driver does not anticipate that an imminent reaction will be necessary. This idea is supported by results from accident analyses which showed that in many cases, rear-end crashes occur in situations which are usually easy to handle (e.g. straight roads, low traffic density). In these situations, drivers may not anticipate that the driver in front will brake and they are thus following too closely to be able to react in time when the front vehicle suddenly brakes or stops. In order to test this hypothesis experimentally, in a driving simulator experiment different expectations were generated by varying the behaviour of a lead car (different braking behaviour, signalling or not before a turn). Driver behaviour was examined after these variations. The analyses partially confirm the influence of different expectations generated by the lead car's behaviour in the first phase of the scenario. Drivers with a respective expectation reacted faster when the car in front suddenly braked and signalled their manoeuvre before turning right at an intersection. However, during a car following phase, drivers did not adapt their speed or distance depending on this expectation. These results can be used to adapt a driver assistance system in car following situations. This should warn and intervene, especially in cases when drivers do not foresee the need for action and therefore cannot react in time.},

An understanding of the factors affecting this complex decision making process is essential to a wide range of theoretical issues including driver workload, capacity and the modeling of freeway flow, as well as practical applications such as the design of in-vehicle driver aids and assistance systems, many of which have direct relevance to increasing driver safety. The study used an instrumented vehicle to collect time dependent following data for a group of test drivers. Data was collected on two differing types of high speed road, using six primary subjects who drove a test vehicle, supplemented by data on 123 drivers that were observed following the test vehicle. Examination was made of how the time headway chosen by a driver is influenced by a range of situational variables commonly believed to effect behavior, with four main findings. Firstly, headway was found to change according to the type of vehicle being followed (i.e. subjects followed closer to trucks than to cars), secondly, little variation was found with changes in overall traffic flow, thirdly, little correlation was found with road type, and lastly a distinct day-to-day variation in individual behavior was observed.},

Unfortunately these vehicle- state-based metrics are limited in their diagnostic value when it comes to trying to assess how: (i) drivers indivi dually adopted different cont rol strategies, (ii) how they individually adapted to the issues under investigation (e.g., in-vehicle task execution, driver support system exposure, or impairment), or (iii) why drivers individually were more or less affected by the factor under study. By representing a driver's behavior in an identifiable com putational driver model, insight is gained into how drivers may differentially bene fit or be impaired by the condition at hand. Such a model also shows how the my riad of possible performance metrics are all “necessarily” correlat ed. Based on test track car following data, a driver car following model is introduced and identif ied for each driver and used to show how drivers differ in their car following cont rol strategies. It is demonstrated that the adopted target time headway (THW) str ongly influences the associated control strategy (i.e., effort) as well as the safety margin (i.e., the minimum THWs experienced) and that subjects who adopt a longer target THW also exhibit a lower bandwidth control stra tegy (i.e., less effort).},

abstract = {Trajectories drawn in a common reference system by all the vehicles on a road are the ultimate empirical data to investigate traffic dynamics. The vast amount of such data made freely available by the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) program is therefore opening up new horizons in studying traffic flow theory. Yet the quality of trajectory data and its impact on the reliability of related studies was a vastly underestimated problem in the traffic literature even before the availability of NGSIM data. The absence of established methods to assess data accuracy and even of a common understanding of the problem makes it hard to speak of reproducibility of experiments and objective comparison of results, in particular in a research field where the complexity of human behaviour is an intrinsic challenge to the scientific method. Therefore this paper intends to design quantitative methods to inspect trajectory data. To this aim first the structure of the error on point measurements and its propagation on the space travelled are investigated. Analytical evidence of the bias propagated in the vehicle trajectory functions and a related consistency requirement are given. Literature on estimation/filtering techniques is then reviewed in light of this requirement and a number of error statistics suitable to inspect trajectory data are proposed. The designed methodology, involving jerk analysis, consistency analysis and spectral analysis, is then applied to the complete set of NGSIM databases.},

abstract = {A number of driver models were fitted to a large data set of human truck driving, from a simulated near-crash, low-friction scenario, yielding two main insights: steering to avoid a collision was best described as an open-loop manoeuvre of predetermined duration, but with situation-adapted amplitude, and subsequent vehicle stabilisation could to a large extent be accounted for by a simple yaw rate nulling control law. These two phenomena, which could be hypothesised to generalise to passenger car driving, were found to determine the ability of four driver models adopted from the literature to fit the human data. Based on the obtained results, it is argued that the concept of internal vehicle models may be less valuable when modelling driver behaviour in non-routine situations such as near-crashes, where behaviour may be better described as direct responses to salient perceptual cues. Some methodological issues in comparing and validating driver models are also discussed.},

abstract = {The functional variation of perception time T in car following is studied for the purpose of introducing a variable time delay into a previously proposed nonlinear model. The basic hypothesis is that the ratio of a just noticeable difference in visual angle ($\Delta$$\theta$) to the visual angle ($\theta$) is a constant. This hypothesis leads to a model in which perception time T is proportional to relative spacing and inversely proportional to relative speed. Experimental results agree very closely with the model for negative relative speeds between 3 and 18 ft/s. A second-order approximation is used to explain behavior for relative speeds of less than 3 ft/s in absolute value. This second-order approximation also agrees well with data taken previously with relative acceleration varying between 1 and 4.7 ft/s2 and initial relative speed between - 1.9 and 2.9 ft/s. A brief discussion of "ideal" following distance b is presented to clarify the stability analysis. The introduction of a variable time delay and ideal following distance into the proposed car-following model changes the size of the minimum asymptotic stability region but not the basic properties of the model. The word "asymptotic" is used in the dynamic stability sense as in the classical control theory literature, not in the sense of platoon stability.},

With the merit on representing traffic conflict through examining the crash mechanism and causality proactively, crash surrogate measures have long been proposed and applied to evaluate the traffic safety. However, the driver's Perception-Reaction Time (PRT), an important variable in crash mechanism, has not been considered widely into surrogate measures. In this regard, it is important to know how the PRT affects the performances of surrogate indicators. To this end, three widely used surrogate measures are firstly modified by involving the PRT into their crash mechanisms. Then, in order to examine the difference caused by the PRT, a comparative study is carried out on a freeway section of the Pacific Motorway, Australia. This result suggests that the surrogate indicators' performances in representing rear-end crash risks are improved with the incorporating of the PRT for the investigated section.},

abstract = {Microscopic simulation models are becoming increasingly important tools in modeling transport systems. There is a large number of models used in many countries. The most difficult stage in the development and use of such models is the calibration and validation of the microscopic sub-models such as the car following and gap acceptance models. This difficulty is due to the lack of suitable methods for adapting models to empirical data. The aim of this paper is to present recent progress in calibrating a number of microscopic traffic flow models. Ten very different models have been tested using data collected via DGPS-equipped cars (Differential Global Positioning System) on a test track in Japan. To calibrate the models, the data of the leading car are fed into the model under consideration and the model is used to compute the headway time series of the following car. The deviations between the measured and the simulated headways are then used to calibrate and validate the models. The calibration results agree with earlier studies as there are errors of 12 {\%} to 17{\%} for all models and no model can be denoted to be the best. The differences between individual drivers are larger than the differences between different models. The validation process gives acceptable errors from 17 {\%} to 22{\%}.

Studies were coded with respect to type of task (e.g., self-reported behaviors vs. observed behaviors), task content (e.g., smoking vs. sex), and 5 age levels. Results showed that the average effects for 14 out of 16 types of risk taking were significantly larger than 0 (indicating greater risk taking in male participants) and that nearly half of the effects were greater than .20. However, certain topics (e.g., intellectual risk taking and physical skills) produced larger gender differences than others (e.g., smoking). In addition, the authors found that (a) there were significant shifts in the size of the gender gap between successive age levels, and (b) the gender gap seems to be growing smaller over time. The discussion focuses on the meaning of the results for theories of risk taking and the need for additional studies to clarify age trends.},

abstract = {Cities are part of the climate change problem, but they are also a key part of the solution. This report$\backslash$noffers a comprehensive analysis of how cities and metropolitan regions can change the way we think about$\backslash$nresponding to climate change. Cities consume the vast majority of global energy and are therefore major$\backslash$ncontributors of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the exposed infrastructure and prevalent$\backslash$ncoastal location of many cities makes them common targets for climate change impacts such as sea level$\backslash$nrise and fiercer storms. This report illustrates how local involvement through “climate-conscious” urban$\backslash$nplanning and management can help achieve national climate goals and minimise tradeoffs between$\backslash$nenvironmental and economic priorities. Six main chapters analyse the link between urbanisation, energy$\backslash$nuse and CO2 emissions; assess the potential contribution of local policies in reducing global energy$\backslash$ndemand and the trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives at the local scale; discuss$\backslash$ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing policies such as the combination of compact growth policies with$\backslash$nthose that improve mass transit linkages; and evaluate a number of tools, including the “greening” of$\backslash$nexisting fiscal policies, financing arrangements to combat climate change at the local level, and green$\backslash$ninnovation and jobs programmes. One of the main messages of this report is that urban policies (e.g.$\backslash$ndensification or congestion charges) can complement global climate policies (e.g. a carbon tax) by$\backslash$nreducing global energy demand, CO2 emissions and the overall abatement costs of reducing carbon$\backslash$nemissions. To inform the groundswell of local climate change action planning, the report highlights best$\backslash$npractices principally from OECD member countries but also from certain non-member countries.},

abstract = {Subjects estimated time of vehicle arrival while viewing twenty-four film clips of an approaching vehicle, half with a constant viewing time of 4.2 s and half with a constant vehicle-movement distance of 40 m. The distances from the subject at which the film ended were 20, 60, and 100 m. Speeds of approach varied between 7.45 and 15.44 m s-1. Performance was strongly dependent on age of the subject. Subjects in the 5-6-year-old group made estimates based on the distance of the vehicle; at 7-8 years an interaction between the effects of distance and velocity appeared and for 9-10-year-olds there was a main effect of the vehicle velocity. Only for adults was the information from distance and velocity fully integrated. There was no significant difference between males and females for any of the age groups. Performance of adults was very similar to that reported by other authors in that subjects underestimated the time to arrival of the vehicle, with estimated times about 60{\%} of the actual times. Standard deviations of the estimated times were such that a small percentage of subjects overestimated times and hence would have caused a collision if they had proceeded with a crossing. The mechanism of time estimation was strongly dependent on the angular velocity of the vehicle subtended at the eye of the observer. This must exceed a threshold value of about 0.002 rad s-1 (adults) if a linear relationship between estimated and actual times is to be obtained. OCR},

@article{Vaa2014,
abstract = {This article presents a brief history and perspective of behavioural model development in traffic psychology. As one specific example of a key behavioural model, Gibson and Crooks (1938), in their classic field theoretical study, offered the first scientific attempt to deal with the issue of compensation. Two central theoretical concepts were developed: "Field of safe travel" and "Minimum stopping zone". The interplay between the two was used to describe and explain risk compensation and illustrated by observing the impact of brakes on driver behaviour: Better brakes could make the field of safe travel - i.e. the distance to the car in front - shorter. Nearly 50 years later, the launch of Wilde's Risk Homeostasis Theory (RHT) gave rise to a profound debate about risk homeostasis and risk compensation. The core issue in the debate was Wilde's strict assertion that all individuals, not only car-drivers, carry an inherent target level of risk that they are seeking to maintain or restore. Gibson and Crooks fell well within psychological theories of the time, while Wilde's RHT emerged more from control theory and economic utility theory than from psychology. In the 1990s neuroscience emerges, especially by Damasio who introduces a paradigm that has proven fruitful as a framework of more recent driver behaviour models. But neuroscience also had its forerunner in Taylor's proposal that driver behaviour is governed by a constancy in Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) which makes driving a self-paced task aiming at keeping the GSR at a constant level. N????t??nen and Summala's integrated Taylor in their "Zero-risk model" which has persisted and still prevails as a solid and well accepted model. Psychological learning theory has, however, rarely been adequately dealt with which is quite odd given the prevalence of speeding and risk compensation which cannot escape explanations based on operant conditioning. The paper discusses the emerging role of psychology and psychological concepts that has been proposed and evolved through the development of driver behaviour models since Gibson and Crooks' study of 1938. The views presented are subjective, they do not represent any attempt to describe the objective reality of the time. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The three layers characterize decision making from a strategic, tactical and operational point of view. The mental models provide the predictive and evaluatory assessments used by the satisficing decision maker to derive an adequate solution (e.g. strategy, decision, action). Driving tasks are categorized into several domains each associated with a mental model. At the lowest level, where interaction with the external world takes place, the mental models are tied to a set of low level perception/action processes from which one or more depending on the situation are activated to accomplish the task. Particular focus is directed to the middle layer where attention management and task scheduling take place.

abstract = {Distraction and inattention contribute to 80{\%} of traffic accidents by delaying or hindering driver responses. However, distraction and inattention are not the only factors increasing response times. In addition, the extent to which different factors-related to the driver, the vehicle, or the environmentinfluence response times in real traffic is still uncertain. Such knowledge may significantly help the development of countermeasures to distraction and inattention. Naturalistic driving data promises to help determine the causes of distraction and inattention by understanding driver behavior in real traffic. Further, large naturalistic datasets are now publically available from a few sources such as UMTRI (University of Michigan Transportation Institute) and VTTI (Virginia Tech Transportation Institute). However, analysis of such data is made difficult by the intrinsic nature of the data: it is large and complex and the variables of interest are hard to control. This study used the public 100-car and 8-truck naturalistic data from VTTI to show how the NatWare toolkit developed at SAFER (Vehicle and Traffic Safety Center at Chalmers) can be used to determine the influence of several factors on response time. Among these factors, attendance to secondary tasks and eyes-off-road, which are indicators of driver's distraction and inattention, significantly delayed response times; the type of incident and response maneuver also affected response times; and finally, truck drivers responded more quickly than car drivers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nowadays, among the microscopic traffic flow modeling approaches, the car-following models are increasingly used by transportation experts to utilize appropriate intelligent transportation systems. Unlike previous works, where the reaction delay is considered to be fixed, in this paper, a modified neural network approach is proposed to simulate and predict the car-following behavior based on the instantaneous reaction delay of the driver-vehicle unit as the human effects. This reaction delay is calculated based on a proposed idea, and the model is developed based on this feature as an input. In this modeling, the inputs and outputs are chosen with respect to the reaction delay to train the neural network model. Using the field data, the performance of the model is calculated and compared with the responses of some existing neural network car-following models. Considering the difference between the responses of the actual plant and the predicted model as the error, comparison shows that the error in the proposed model is significantly smaller than that that in the other models. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper uses the method of kinematic waves, developed in part I, but may be read independently. A functional relationship between flow and concentration for traffic on crowded arterial roads has been postulated for some time, and has experimental backing (? 2). From this a theory of the propagation of changes in traffic distribution along these roads may be deduced (?? 2, 3). The theory is applied (? 4) to the problem of estimating how a 'hump', or region of increased concentration, will move along a crowded main road. It is suggested that it will move slightly slower than the mean vehicle speed, and that vehicles passing through it will have to reduce speed rather suddenly (at a 'shock wave') on entering it, but can increase speed again only very gradually as they leave it. The hump gradually spreads out along the road, and the time scale of this process is estimated. The behaviour of such a hump on entering a bottleneck, which is too narrow to admit the increased flow, is studied (? 5), and methods are obtained for estimating the extent and duration of the resulting hold-up. The theory is applicable principally to traffic behaviour over a long stretch of road, but the paper concludes (? 6) with a discussion of its relevance to problems of flow near junctions, including a discussion of the starting flow at a controlled junction. In the introductory sections 1 and 2, we have included some elementary material on the quantitative study of traffic flow for the benefit of scientific readers unfamiliar with the subject.},

abstract = {In the present paper, a theory-based advancement of the car following model of Wiedemann is introduced. It is suitable for a more realistic simulation of human longitudinal guidance behaviour in the lower velocity range, like in urban traffic. The algorithm was identified and developed by means of a driving simulator study, which is introduced as well. While the decision making process in recent car following models based on Wiedemann is solely determined by the time headway to the leading vehicle, the results of the study show that information about time to collision is also used in the lower velocity range. This approach delivers a more realistic simulation of human car following behaviour, which can be integrated into driver models for microscopic traffic simulations and for the control of surrounding traffic in driving simulators.},

abstract = {As large cities seek to expand their transit systems to accommodate increasing travel demand, provide alternatives to growing road traffic congestion, and improve accessibility, more research attention has been focused on the land use effects of transit, most notably in the form of transit-oriented development (TOD). Many cities in the USA are starting or expanding rail transit systems with objectives that include more focused economic development near transit stations and along transit corridors. Denver, Colorado is one of the cities that is aggressively expanding its rail transit system and encouraging high-density, mixed-use development in the station areas. This study analyzes TOD data from the Denver Regional Transportation District and the Denver Regional Council of Governments for 0.5-mile areas around current and proposed rail transit stations. Early evidence indicates that the scope of transit-oriented development in Denver is considerable, resulting in nearly 18,000 residential dwelling units, 5.3 million square feet of retail space, 5.4 million square feet of office space, and 6.2 million square feet of medical space within one-half mile of existing or planned transit stations from 1997 to 2010. As one of the critical elements of the regional land use and transportation plan, the rail transit system and the emphasis on transit-oriented development is contributing to an increase in the average density of the Denver urbanized area.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on optimization, the search for the optimum or best outcome to a problem and emphasizes on making the best decision when voting for candidates and choosing among alternatives. It reviews several well-founded techniques, including calculus, linear programming (LP), and geometric programming (GP). It is particularly important to recognize that any search for an optimum solution is to some extent “biased” or influenced by the way the question is framed. This is most evident in the discussion of voting and the expression of preferences, but it is also the case in the more “rigorous” calculus- and programming based approaches. The choice of the cheapest design or product is usually based on money as the metric, not the design's esthetics or the product's effects on the environment. To be sure, such externals can be taken into account, but the means for so doing are neither rigorous nor entirely objective. While linear programming is a very valuable tool and an important part of operations research, there are many other optimization techniques, including nonlinear, integer, dynamic, and geometric programming..},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The use of microscopic simulation models to assess the likely effects of new traffic management applications and changes in vehicle technology is becoming increasingly popular. However the validity of the models is a topic of increasing concern, as the quality of the presentation often exceeds the models ability to predict what is likely to happen. Traditionally, model validity has been ascertained through comparing outputs aggregated at a macroscopic level such as speed flow and lane use, against real data. Little microscopic comparison is generally possible and, where this is done there is often no separation of the calibration and validation process. This paper demonstrates how microscopic validation may be undertaken when suitable data is available, in this case time series data collected by an instrumented vehicle, and its use in the validation of the car following performance of a fuzzy logic based car following model. Good agreement has been attained between the simulated model and observed data, primarily using a root mean square error indicator. Lastly, a brief comparison of the new model with the performance of a number of existing formulations has also been undertaken. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Research using the driver behaviour questionnaire (DBQ) has found that aberrant driving behaviours can be categorised into: errors, lapses and violations (and aggressive violations, depending on the version of the DBQ used). There is also extensive evidence that it is only the 'violations' score which is significantly correlated with, and predictive of, crash involvement. This consistency has been found both across different samples and different countries. However, recent research conducted on those driving cars in a work-related context has found a different factor structure and a different pattern of correlations with crash involvement. The present study extends this research by investigating the factor structure of the DBQ and the relationship between aberrant driving behaviour and crash involvement for a sample of truck drivers. Factor analysis yielded a four factor solution, that broadly replicated the four hypothetical factors (errors, lapses, violations and aggressive violations) found in the general driving population. Only the violations factor was found to be significantly predictive of crash involvement. This research provides evidence of the robust nature of the DBQ findings in populations other than the drivers of private motor vehicles. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Car-following models are always of great interest of traffic engineers and researchers. In the age of mass data, this paper proposes a nonparametric car-following model driven by field data. Different from most of the existing car-following models, neither driver's behaviour parameters nor fundamental diagrams are assumed in the data-driven model. The model is proposed based on the simple k-nearest neighbour, which outputs the average of the most similar cases, i.e., the most likely driving behaviour under the current circumstance. The inputs and outputs are selected, and the determination of the only parameter k is introduced. Three simulation scenarios are conducted to test the model. The first scenario is to simulate platoons following real leaders, where traffic waves with constant speed and the detailed trajectories are observed to be consistent with the empirical data. Driver's rubbernecking behaviour and driving errors are simulated in the second and third scenarios, respectively. The time–space diagrams of the simulated trajectories are presented and explicitly analysed. It is demonstrated that the model is able to well replicate periodic traffic oscillations from the precursor stage to the decay stage. Without making any assumption, the fundamental diagrams for the simulated scenario coincide with the empirical fundamental diagrams. These all validate that the model can well reproduce the traffic characteristics contained by the field data. The nonparametric car-following model exhibits traffic dynamics in a simple and parsimonious manner.},

The purpose of this study is to explain the unsafe driver actions and conditions that are more likely in fatal crashes between cars and large trucks than in fatal crashes between cars and to identify strategies for edu- cating motorists in safe driving practices that will help them avoid such crashes. It is important to note again that, because of data limitations, this study looked only at fatal crashes. Nevertheless, the findings from this study are consistent with the findings from a study of unsafe driving acts of car drivers in the vicinity of trucks that was not limited to fatal crashes. It also needs to be noted that three of the four driver factors that were found in this study to be more likely to be associated with fatal car-truck crashes than with fatal car-car crashes were among those considered by safety experts to be dangerous and frequent near trucks. A key finding of this study is that most of the 94 unsafe driver acts were about as likely in fatal car-truck crashes as in fatal car-car crashes. Therefore general safe driving practices are also relevant around large trucks. However, programs to educate drivers in safe practices need to emphasize that driving mis- takes around trucks can have much more severe consequences.},

abstract = {When one car follows another, the driver of the following car makes spacing judgments based on observing the lead ear within his field of vision. This visual field depends on a variety of design features of the following car, such as hood geometry, and is difficult to quantify simply. One quantity which relates to the driver visual field is the amount of roadway obscured from his view by his automobile. It is possible that the amount of this obscuration could influence spacing judgments. Furthermore, it is possible the size of the lead car, as characterized by the rear bumper length, might influence, spacing judgments. A laboratory experiment using color slides was devised to investigate if the amount of forward obscuration or target size influenced apparent spacing. The color slides showed the view of a driver seated in one car following another. Two different models of cars, with different values of forward obscuration and target size, served as lead and following cars. The influence of forward obscuration was also investigated by elevating the rear of one of the following cars. It was found that the lead ear target size did not systematically influence apparent spacing. On the other hand, changes in forward obscuration, whether caused by different following cars, or by elevating the rear of the same car, did influence apparent spacing; the same spacing appeared greater for smaller forward obscuration. These findings are related to reported test-track results.},

abstract = {Density is a key component in the recent surge of mixed-use neighborhood developments. Empirical research has shown an inconsistent picture on the impact of density. In particular, it is unclear whether it is the density or the variables that go long with density that affect peoples travel behavior. Many existing studies on density neglect confounding factors, for example, residential self-selection, generalized travel cost, accessibility, and access to transit stations. In addition, most still use a single trip as their observation unit, even though trip chaining is well recognized. The goal of this paper is to assess the role of density in affecting mode choice decisions in home-based work tours, while controlling for confounding factors. Using the dataset collected in the New York Metropolitan Region, we estimated a simultaneous two-equation system comprising two mutually interacting dependent variables: car ownership and the propensity to use auto. The results confirm the role of density after controlling for the confounding factors; in particular, employment density at work exerts more influence than residential density at home. The study also demonstrates the importance of using tour as the analysis unit in mode choice decisions. The study advances the field by analyzing the role of the built environment on home-based work tours. New knowledge is obtained in the relative con- tribution of density vs. a set of correlated factors, including generalized travel cost, accessibility, and access to transit stations.},

The present paper reports results from simulated and real motorway driving. Data were collected in a fixed base simulator, a moving base simulator and an instrumented vehicle driven in real traffic. The data collected included speed, lane keeping performance, steering wheel movements, eye movements, physiological signals and self-reported driving performance. The results show that the effects of visual and cognitive load affect driving performance in qualitatively different ways. Visual demand led to reduced speed and increased lane keeping variation. By contrast, cognitive load did not affect speed and resulted in reduced lane keeping variation. Moreover, the cognitive load resulted in increased gaze concentration towards the road centre. Both S-IVIS had an effect on physiological signals and the drivers' assessment of their own driving performance. The study also investigated differences between the three experimental settings (static simulator, moving base simulator and field). The results are discussed with respect to the development of a generic safety test regime for In-vehicle Information Systems.},

abstract = {Predictive processing has been proposed as a unifying framework for understanding brain function, suggesting that cognition and behaviour can be fundamentally understood based on the single principle of prediction error minimisation. According to predictive processing, the brain is a statistical organ that continuously attempts get a grip on states in the world by predicting how these states cause sensory input and minimising the deviations between the predicted and actual input. While these ideas have had a strong influence in neuroscience and cognitive science, they have so far not been adopted in applied human factors research. The present paper represents a first attempt to do so, exploring how predictive processing concepts can be used to understand automobile driving.

abstract = {Drivers' perception-cognition-response mechanism before the hazards developing into actual crashes is a key issue of driving safety. Previous explanations on this topic are generally based on the perception-response (PR) process or risk-homeostasis (RH) mechanism. However, a micro-description and related evidences as the bridge between the existing theoretical frameworks are limited. In order to generate a better understanding of crash development, the present study examined the visual perception, electrodermal activity and behavioral responses in a uniformed hazardous situation during simulator driving. Ninety-seven drivers were recruited to complete a pre-defined driving task containing a baseline scenario and a paired hazard scenario. The results demonstrated that the crash and no-crash drivers showed similar performances in terms of PR time. However, two driver groups showed differed hazard anticipation (indicated by aroused electrodermal activity) and demonstrated distinguishable driving behaviors (measured by gas pedal, velocity and time-to-collision) before the hazard was visually detected. These findings evidenced the anticipatory risk perception and the subsequent concurrent functions of the RH mechanism and PR process at the critical moment before the occurrence of possible crashes. Therefore, a fused RH/PR framework was proposed to describe the drivers' control loop during crash avoidance. Accordingly, several interventions were suggested to reduce crash risk.},

abstract = {Safety is emerging as an area of increased attention and awareness within transportation engineering. Historically, safety has been difficult to assess for new and innovative traffic treatments, primarily due to the lack of good predictive models of accident potential and lack of consensus on what constitutes a safe or unsafe facility. This FHWA-sponsored research project is intended to investigate the potential for deriving surrogate measures of safety from existing traffic simulation models. These surrogate measures could then be used to support traffic engineering alternatives evaluation with respect to safety without costly accident studies or construction. In addition, the measures available from simulation models are much more detailed that the subjective measures based on human observers. The first task was to review the literature in surrogate safety analysis and focus the research on surrogate measures for intersection safety. The second task was to review the capabilities of existing simulation models that are commercially available for producing surrogate measures. The third task was to specify some functional requirements for a software tool that would analyze surrogate measures produced by the simulation model(s). The final task of the research was to describe the algorithmic approach required for obtaining surrogate measures from simulation models. Each surrogate measure is collected based on the occurrence of a conflict event {\~{n}} an interaction between two vehicles in which one vehicle must take evasive action to avoid a collision. Because of the limited modeling of the environment and some driver behavior assumptions in simulation models, surrogates for single-vehicle safety are not specified (e.g. risk of run-off-road at a high-speed curve). The surrogates that are proposed as the {\`{i}}best{\^{i}} measures are the time to collision, post encroachment time, deceleration rate, maximum speed, and speed differential. Time to collision, post encroachment time, and deceleration rate can be used to measure the severity of the conflict. Maximum speed and the speed differential can be used to measure the severity of the potential collision (along with information about the mass of the vehicles involved to assess momentum). Definitions of the possible conflict events and algorithms for calculating the surrogate measures for conflict points and lines are presented. Some modifications to the interfaces to commercial simulation models will be required to obtain the necessary data on each conflict event. After executing the simulation model for a number of iterations, a post- processing tool would be used to compute the statistics of the various measures and perform comparisons between design alternatives.},

Male drivers reported engaging in risky driving behaviors more frequently than female drivers and teen drivers reported engaging in risky driving behaviors more frequently than adult drivers. Positive affect (liking for risky driving behaviors) and perceived risk mediated the relationships of age and gender with risky driving. Affect and risk perception were independent predictors of risky driving behavior. Interactions of positive affect and perceived risk with gender and age showed that positive affect more strongly predicted risky driving for teen and male drivers than for adult and female drivers. These findings are interpreted in the context of dual process models of behavioral decision making. Future research into interventions designed to moderate the positive affect surrounding driving may have promise for reducing risky driving behavior. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Based on these observations, a classification of the manoeuvres into free, forced and cooperative lane changes is proposed. A new lane change model is developed, incorporating explicit modelling of vehicle interactions using intelligent agent concepts. The model was implemented in the ARTEMiS traffic simulator, and several hypothetical test studies were conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the new model. The results show that the model is able to reproduce the observed behaviour of individual vehicles in terms of speed, gap acceptance and conflict-resolution in all three types of lane change manoeuvres, and hence, it is able to simulate highly congested flow conditions in a realistic manner. The macroscopic results in terms of speed-flow relationship are close to the typical expected results. The model can simulate both freeways and signalised urban arterial networks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for using vehicle trajectory data to study the intradriver heterogeneity of driving behavior between the acceleration process and the deceleration process. Trajectory data were collected during peak hours on Dutch Motorway A2. Criteria were proposed for the selection of subtrajectories corresponding to both the acceleration and the deceleration processes of car-following. With the application of these subtrajectories to calibrate three types of models (the Helly model, the Gipps model, and the intelligent driver model), it was found that obvious intradriver heterogeneities existed in driving behaviors between the acceleration and deceleration processes of car-following: (a) the average response time of drivers in the acceleration process was longer than that in the deceleration process according to the prediction of the Helly and intelligent driver models; (b) drivers were apt to respond more intensively to surrounding traffic in the deceleration process than they did in the acceleration process; and (c) more than 65{\%} of drivers involved in this study drove in obviously different styles between the acceleration and deceleration processes. Moreover, a compensation for the response delay from model parameters was observed, and all three models presented low robustness in predicting driving behaviors of one car-following process with the parameters optimized from the data of other car-following processes. This work not only provides insight into intradriver heterogeneity in car-following behaviors but also suggests some important criteria for car-following modeling.},

Car following behavior and the decision-making habits of drivers seem fundamental to understanding how to avoid these rear-end crashes. The present research aimed to reveal factors that govern car following under conditions of reduced visibility. It employed a KQ-Vection high-fidelity driving simulator to measure the behavior of automobile drivers following a lead vehicle at 13.4 m/s (30 MPH) or 22.4 m/s (50 MPH) under three visibility conditions--clear or one of two densities of simulated fog. At the higher speed, fog conditions separated participants into a group that stayed within visible range of the lead car, even though the headway time violated the NHTSA recommendations for the speed involved, and another group that lagged beyond the visible range. Data were compared to the model of Van Winsum for car following (The human element in car following models. Transportation Research Part F 2, 1999). Contrast and image size measurements allowed comparison to a standard contrast sensitivity function and allowed estimation of the JND term in the Van Winsum model.},

abstract = {Freight trucks are an important component of the nation's highway traffic. Due to their physical and operational characteristics, they can significantly impact traffic system performance, safety, and the travel experience of non-truck drivers. Methodological gaps exist in the literature on modeling car-truck interactions that do not result in crashes, especially those resulting from non-truck driver behavior. This paper focuses on the modeling of the behavior of non-truck drivers in the vicinity of trucks to capture these interactions. This is done by quantifying a time-dependent "discomfort level" for every non-truck driver interacting with trucks in the ambient traffic stream. The driver socioeconomic characteristics and situational factors that affect this discomfort are identified through a stated preference survey of non-truck drivers and a preliminary analysis of the survey data using a discrete choice model. A fuzzy logic based approach is proposed to determine the en-route time-dependent non-truck driver discomfort level. This is used in conjunction with the car-following and lane-changing logics of a traditional traffic flow model to generate a truck-following model and a modified lane-changing model in the vicinity of trucks. An agent-based freeway segment traffic flow simulator is constructed using the extended microscopic flow modeling logic. It provides a simulation-based framework to analyze alternative strategies to mitigate car-truck interactions. Experiments are conducted to analyze the sensitivity of the discomfort level to the causal variables, and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Transportation agencies have traditionally relied on historical crash records as the primary measure to evaluate the safety of roadways. The infrequent and sporadic occurrence of accidents and the long period required to collect accident data have led to the use of surrogate safety measures. The use of microsimulation modeling for conflict analysis has been popularized for evaluating experimental changes to existing road networks. Previous freeway studies have used a simplified time-to-collision definition, which produces unrealistic conflict situations. The definition included situations with no collision path, such as when two vehicles were traveling at the same speed or when the leading vehicle was speeding away from the following vehicle. A revised conflict definition is developed to address these issues and is then contrasted with the simplified definition used in earlier studies. An investigation of acceleration rates demonstrates that the revised approach retains the meaningful conflicts produced by the previous definition but eliminates the situations that are unlikely to be conflicts. This revised conflict definition is used to investigate the evaluation of a truck-only highway in the greater Toronto, Ontario, Canada, area to observe the effects on traffic conflicts. In general, it was found that although providing a separate highway for trucks did reduce truck-related conflicts, car lane-change conflicts increased because of the cars' increased maneuverability and presence on the truck-free highway.},

All the drivers had a driving experience of 6{\^{a}}18 months. Information about offences for a 2-year period was obtained from an official register of drivers' licences. The drivers were classified into three age brackets: 18{\^{a}}20, 21{\^{a}}30 and 31{\^{a}}50 years. The effect of driving experience was controlled by dividing the drivers into different mileage brackets. The data was analysed and the results were discussed in the framework of the hierarchical model of driving behaviour. Young novice drivers and especially young male drivers showed more problems connected to the higher hierarchical levels of driving behaviour than middle-aged novice drivers. The number of accidents and offences was highest among the young males and their accidents took place more often at night than female or older drivers' accidents. Female drivers showed more problems connected to the lower hierarchical levels of driving behaviour, e.g. problems in vehicle handling skills. Ways of measuring accident risk of different driver groups were also discussed, as well as the usefulness and reliability of self-reports in accident studies.},

@article{Wang2016,
abstract = {Rear-end collisions have been estimated to account for 20–30{\%} of all crashes, and about 10{\%} of all fatal crashes. A thorough investigation of drivers' collision avoidance behaviors when exposed to rear end collision risks is needed to help guide the development of effective countermeasures. Urgency or criticality of the situation affects drivers' collision behavior, but has not been systematically investigated. A high fidelity driving simulator was used to examine the effects of differing levels of situational urgency on drivers' collision avoidance behaviors. Drivers' braking and steering decisions, perception response times, throttle release response times, throttle to brake transition times, brake delays, maximum brake pedal pressures and peak decelerations were recorded under lead vehicle decelerations of 0.3 g, 0.5 g, and 0.75 g and under headways of 1.5 s and 2.5 s. Results showed (1) as situational urgency increased, drivers released the accelerator and braked to maximum more quickly; (2) the transition time between initial throttle release and brake initiation was not affected by situational urgency; (3) at low situational urgency, multi-stage braking behavior led to longer delays from brake initiation to full braking. These findings show that effects of situational urgency on drivers' response times, braking delays, and braking intensity should be considered when developing forward collision warnings systems.},

abstract = {This study develops a method of calibrating and validating the Wiedemann car-following model using vehicle trajectory data. Unlike sensitivity analysis and optimization, this method conforms to the assumptions of the original Wiedemann 99 model related to drivers' car-following behavior. Eight calibration constants (CCs) of the model were estimated using the vehicle trajectory data from a section of the US-101 freeway in Los Angeles, California. CC1 (desired time gap from lead vehicle) and CC2 (maximum change in spacing) were determined from the observed maximum and minimum spacing between the lead and following vehicles with similar speeds. CC4 and CC5 (minimum relative velocity at which the driver starts decelerating and accelerating, respectively, with short spacing of the lead vehicle or so-called action points) and CC6 (effect of spacing on these action points) were determined using a segmented linear regression model. This model provided the estimated relative velocities at which the speed of a following vehicle changed in response to a lead vehicle using constant acceleration/deceleration. It was found that the absolute values of CC4 and CC5 were not the same, which indicates that drivers are more sensitive to lead vehicles in the closing process than the opening process. CC7 was calculated as the mean difference in constant accelerations of lead and following vehicles. CC8 was calculated as the mean acceleration of all vehicles 1 s after the vehicles increased from slow speeds ({\textless}5.5 km/h). Moreover, CC9 was calculated as the mean acceleration for speeds between 79.5 and 80.5 km/h. The traffic simulation with the estimated CCs in this study better reflected the observed speed distributions and action points than simulations with CCs estimated in previous studies using the same trajectory data.},

@article{Fadhloun2020a,
abstract = {The research presented in this paper proposes and develops a new car-following model, which we term the Fadhloun-Rakha (FR) model. The FR model incorporates the key components of the Rakha-Pasumarthy-Adjerid (RPA) model in that it uses the same steady state formulation, respects vehicle dynamics, and uses very similar collision-avoidance strategies to ensure safe following distances between vehicles. The main contributions of the FR model over the RPA model are the following: (1) it models the driver throttle and brake pedal input; (2) it captures driver variability; (3) it allows for shorter than steady-state following distances when following faster leading vehicles; (4) it offers a much smoother acceleration profile while converging to steady states; and (5) it explicitly captures driver perception and control inaccuracies and errors. Besides describing the methodology and the role of each of the model parameters, this study evaluates the performance of the new model using a naturalistic driving dataset. A brief comparative analysis was performed to validate the model with regard to replicating empirical driver and vehicle behavior. Through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation, the proposed FR model demonstrates a significant decrease in the modeling error when compared to the original RPA model and generates trajectories that are highly consistent with empirically observed car-following behavior.},

@inproceedings{Markkula2014,
abstract = {Building on ideas from contemporary neuroscience, a framework is proposed in which drivers' steering and pedal behavior is modeled as a series of individual control adjustments, triggered after accumulation of sensory evidence for the need of an adjustment, or evidence that a previous or ongoing adjustment is not achieving the intended results. Example simulations are provided. Specifically, it is shown that evidence accumulation can account for previously unexplained variance in looming detection thresholds and brake onset timing. It is argued that the proposed framework resolves a discrepancy in the current driver modeling literature, by explaining not only the short-latency, well-tuned, closed-loop type of control of routine driving, but also the degradation into long-latency, ill-tuned open-loop control in more rare, unexpected, and urgent situations such as near-accidents.

abstract = {In this commentary, it is argued that the car following models discussed in Brackstone, M., and McDonald, M. (Transportation Research - Part F (2000), pp. 181-196) ignore one or more of the following issues that characterize to observed driver behavior. These include: (i) car following is only one of many tasks that drivers perform simultaneously and receives therefore only intermittent attention and control (task scheduling/attention management), (ii) drivers are satisfied with a range of conditions that extend beyond the boundaries imposed by perceptual and control limitation (satisficing instead of optimal performance evaluation), and (iii) in each driving task drivers use a set of highly informative perceptual variables to guide decision making and control (perceptual rather than Newtonian input). To elucidate these issues, a general driver modeling framework is presented in which the car-following task is highlighted (Boer, E. R., {\&} Hoedemaeker, M. (1998).

It contains information on Canadian government, culture and geography.\n\nThere is also a lot of history sprinkled throughout the text, containing the exact year when something important happened. For example, the current border between Canada and The United States of America was partly a result of the 1812 war between the two countries.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/FejKb3bDS5c9a/giphy.gif){width=\"50%\"}\n\n## Can I use R to create a history timeline?\n\nAs a new reader, trying to remember all of the Canadian histoy seems very daunting. I personally prefer a timeline with year and `what happened` information. So, I initially thought to create something like that by hand, but then:\n\n-   I recalled that *Discover Canada* is also available as a pdf and I could potentially import it in `R` as text\n-   I had heard the term *corpus* used for text documents in `R`, and thought that I could maybe convert the imported text into a corpus. A recent [R Ladies webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYuTFy_JRLA) showed exactly how (Thank you R-Ladies Tunis!)\n-   With text in `R`, I could use the `tidytext` package to extract the sentences and then get the history by years\n-   Finally, I could create a table with history in each year in increasing order using `reactable` package. My starting point here was [Tom Mock's blog](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-reactable-tables-the-rest-of-the-owl/) (thanks Tom!)\n\n## Step 1: From pdf to dataframe\n\nI started by loading the `pdftools` and `quanteda` libraries for reading the *Discover Canada* pdf file and converting it into a corpus.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_16017907f96b400c8e52d5f0a804f498'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(pdftools))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(quanteda)) \n```\n:::\n\n\nI first downloaded the large print pdf file from the [Discover Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/discover-canada.html). Following shows the page 13 from the pdf:\n\n![Page 13 from the Large Print pdf of Discover Canada](dc_pg13.PNG){width=\"50\"}\n\nNext, I read this file in `R`:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_1ab6010ea909e7ee393c5cbce09f7fdd'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npdf_text <- pdf_text(pdf = \"discover-large.pdf\")\n\nhead(pdf_text, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"             STUDY GUIDE\\r\\n           Discover Canada\\r\\nThe Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship\\r\\n          LARGE PRINT\\r\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n[2] \"     2\\r\\n\\t\\r  \\r\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n[3] \"The Oath of Citizenship\\r\\nI swear (or affirm)\\r\\nThat I will be faithful\\r\\nAnd bear true allegiance\\r\\nTo Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second\\r\\nQueen of Canada\\r\\nHer Heirs and Successors\\r\\nAnd that I will faithfully observe\\r\\nThe laws of Canada\\r\\nAnd fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen.\\r\\nLe serment de citoyenneté\\r\\nJe jure (ou j’affirme solennellement)\\r\\nQue je serai fidèle\\r\\nEt porterai sincère allégeance\\r\\nà Sa Majesté la Reine Elizabeth Deux\\r\\nReine du Canada\\r\\nÀ ses héritiers et successeurs\\r\\nQue j’observerai fidèlement les lois du Canada\\r\\nEt que je remplirai loyalement mes obligations\\r\\nde citoyen canadien.\\r\\n                                   3\\r\\n\\t\\r  \\r\\n\" \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe next step was to convert the raw text into a corpus. This is possible with the `corpus()` function from the `quanteda` package:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_27455ab0b805453640734c7464390ac1'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndc_corpus <- corpus(pdf_text)\n\ndocvars(dc_corpus)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ndata frame with 0 columns and 129 rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `quanteda::docvars()` function lets you find the existing variables and create new variables for the documents in a corpus. There were 129 text \"documents\" in `dc_corpus` (you can find it with `length(dc_corpus)`). We know that there is only 1 document that I am using here, but the `pdftools::pdftext()` function split the original text into 129 parts. That's why the corpus now has 129 documents.\n\n### Interlude: Tokenization and Visualization of Text Data\n\nNow that the data is living in a corpus, there is a lot that I can do in terms of text analysis. For instance, [this awesome post](https://nlp-bergen.netlify.app/) by the R-Ladies presenter, [Cosima Meyer](https://twitter.com/cosima_meyer) introduces the terms for natural language processing and also shows how to clean and visualize text data. Based on that code, I produced a word cloud in three steps below, all powered by the `quanteda` package:\n\n-   Pre-process the text by removing punctuation, symbols and URL, and splitting the hyphenated words. This pre-processed result is called as tokens.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_a402c7599a5dbea7544f2741278a5431'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Text pre-processing\ndc_tokens <- tokens(\n    # Takes the corpus\n    dc_corpus,\n    # Remove punctuation\n    remove_punct = TRUE,\n    # Remove symbols\n    remove_symbols = TRUE,\n    # Remove URL\n    remove_url = TRUE,\n    # Split up hyphenated words\n    split_hyphens = TRUE\n  )\n\n\nhead(dc_tokens, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTokens consisting of 3 documents.\ntext1 :\n [1] \"STUDY\"            \"GUIDE\"            \"Discover\"         \"Canada\"          \n [5] \"The\"              \"Rights\"           \"and\"              \"Responsibilities\"\n [9] \"of\"               \"Citizenship\"      \"LARGE\"            \"PRINT\"           \n\ntext2 :\n[1] \"2\"\n\ntext3 :\n [1] \"The\"         \"Oath\"        \"of\"          \"Citizenship\" \"I\"          \n [6] \"swear\"       \"or\"          \"affirm\"      \"That\"        \"I\"          \n[11] \"will\"        \"be\"         \n[ ... and 87 more ]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Create a document-feature matrix (DFM). DFM estimates the frequency of each word ('feature') across all the text components ('documents'). While creating DFM you can also *stem* words. Stemming refers to finding the common root of several words. For example, *government* and *governor* have the same root **govern**. Moreover, you can remove the *stopwords* that are common words in the language e.g. *the*, *are*, etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_a54564834a6411f6805a4297c7901ce3'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate a document-feature matrix (DFM)\n\ndc_dfm <- dfm(\n  # Take the token object\n  dc_tokens,\n  # Lower the words\n  tolower = TRUE,\n  # Get the stem of the words\n  stem = TRUE,\n  # Remove stop words\n  remove = stopwords(\"english\")\n)\n\ndc_dfm\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nDocument-feature matrix of: 129 documents, 3,008 features (97.7% sparse).\n       features\ndocs    studi guid discov canada right respons citizenship larg print 2\n  text1     1    1      1      1     1       1           1    1     1 0\n  text2     0    0      0      0     0       0           0    0     0 1\n  text3     0    0      0      4     0       0           1    0     0 0\n  text4     0    0      0      5     1       0           1    0     0 0\n  text5     0    0      0      5     2       2           4    0     0 0\n  text6     0    1      0      2     2       1           1    0     0 0\n[ reached max_ndoc ... 123 more documents, reached max_nfeat ... 2,998 more features ]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Create a wordcloud:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_ff8931ecd4beb7ca81ee92b16c167322'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(wesanderson))\n\ntextplot_wordcloud(\n  # Load the DFM object\n  dc_dfm,\n  # Define the minimum number the words have to occur\n  min_count = 3,\n  # Define the maximum number the words can occur\n  max_words = 500,\n  # Define a color\n  color = wes_palette(\"Royal1\")\n  \n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs expected, **canada** was the most common word across all the paragraphs of text.\n\nGoing back to our task of creating a dataframe out of the corpus, the following code shows how to do that (thanks to this [answer on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33193705/2829961)):\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_e8b43cdec0f2c701dad49370ed4e14b8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\n# Corpus to dataframe\ndc_df <- data.frame(text = sapply(dc_corpus, as.character), \n           stringsAsFactors = FALSE, row.names = NULL) %>% \n         as_tibble()\n\nhead(dc_df, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 x 1\n  text                                                                          \n  <chr>                                                                         \n1 \"             STUDY GUIDE\\n           Discover Canada\\nThe Rights and Respons~\n2 \"     2\\n\\t\\n  \\n\"                                                            \n3 \"The Oath of Citizenship\\nI swear (or affirm)\\nThat I will be faithful\\nAnd b~\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Step 2: Split the text paragraph in each row into sentences\n\nI used the `tidytext` package for this step:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='making-a-history-table-from-discover-canada-in-r_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_3ceb3917f2813980190b3a4f370ed646'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidytext))\n## divide into sentences\ndc_df_sent <- dc_df %>% \n  unnest_tokens(output = sentence, input = text, token = \"sentences\")\n\nhead(dc_df_sent, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 x 1\n  sentence                                                                      \n  <chr>                                                                         \n1 study guide            discover canada the rights and responsibilities of cit~\n2 2                                                                             \n3 the oath of citizenship i swear (or affirm) that i will be faithful and bear ~\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Step 3: Find the sentences containing years\n\nI found all those sentences that contained a four-digit number that indicated a year in the text.
